If your idea of a luxury car is one that pampers, impresses and occasionally thrills when the road turns winding, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class should prove a very satisfying purchase. Vast improvements in interior design and materials help the 2016 C-Class shed its “entry-level” status.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
While the C-Class’ styling is decidedly less stodgy than MB cars of yore, the chassis and steering feedback still don’t approach that of BMW, Cadillac or Audi cars. Those seeking similar creature comforts but not the lofty price tag might find more to like in a Chrysler 300 or Hyundai Genesis.","The Mercedes-Benz C-Class for 2016 has come into its own, a worthy adversary to cars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. Fresh from a complete redesign last year, the 2016 car is larger, wider, lighter and more posh than previous-generation C-Class sedans. The C-Class offers new levels of luxury on the inside and ever greater performance under the skin, where a new C450 AMG model adds another option to the multifaceted C-Class lineup. And, while we’re pretty sure the C-Class won’t excite BMW autocrossers, it should appeal to those seeking big luxury-car trappings in a body not much bigger than a midsize sedan. Although the C-Class coupe was a carryover from last year, the new coupe will debut as 2017 model.","With the exception of the AMG cars, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class was never known for its stellar athleticism. But, in the 2016 C-Class sedan something is stirring that might begin to...","Favorite Features 
 
AIRMATIC SUSPENSION 
Once a feature found only on high-end Mercedes cars, the Airmatic suspension on the 2016 C-Class sedan helps control the ride and lessen the somewhat harsh feel afforded by the car’s run-flat tires. Four driver-selectable settings include Comfort, ECO, Sport and Sport +. 
 
DRIVER ASSISTANCE PACKAGE 
The Driver Assistance Package on the 2016 C-Class features active lane-keeping and blind-spot assist, available via the adaptive cruise control that makes driving in heavy traffic an effortless affair.","Lovely. Few other words suffice when it comes to describing the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan's interior, especially on the heels of the former generation, which had a cold, clinical demeanor. The C-Class comes available with an attractive array of wood and aluminum finishes, and a relatively clutter-free layout that manages to still feel elegant. Central to the de-cluttering is a simple rotary dial and touch pad that responds to gestural inputs, swipes and handwriting. Adding to the upscale feel is an available Air Balance Package with a fragrance diffuser that atomizes perfume into the air-conditioning system.","At first glance, the Mercedes C-Class bears a strong resemblance to the E-Class and S-Class – and yes, it certainly does borrow cues including the aggressive front grilles, sweeping character lines, and taut rear end. However, the C’s compact proportions give it a more purposeful appearance that’s a bit sterner than the jaunty CLA. If you crave a snazzier look, the 3-pointed star on the grille can be lit up with LEDs for an extra $480, while a Sport package brings more aggressive bodywork and wheels.","The Mercedes-Benz C300 for 2016 features a decent amount of standard equipment, including dual-zone climate control, keyless start and a touch-pad-operated multimedia interface. A rearview camera is bundled into a $2,690 Multimedia Package, though it can be ordered a la carte for $460. Standard items on the C450 AMG get more substantial, including Bluetooth audio streaming, 14-way-power sport seats, AMG adaptive sport suspension, adaptive braking, Collision Prevention Assist and ECO start/stop. Optional features that are standard on most of the C-Class’s competitors include heated seats, navigation and leather upholstery.","Optional Equipment 
There are seemingly endless ways to load up the C-Class’s amenities. Opt for the Interior Package, and you’ll get leather (which you’d think would be standard on a car of this caliber), ventilated seats, and multicolor LED ambient lighting. A Multimedia Package adds an 8.4-inch navigation screen, voice control and a 10-gigabyte music hard drive. The Parking Assist Package ($1,290) adds the Surround View camera and Parktronic w/Active Parking Assist. Airmatic suspension adds $1,190 to the C300’s premium, and if you’re looking for features you never knew you needed, you’ll want the cabin fragrance system for $350.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2016 C-Class sedan from Mercedes comes with a potent turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that acts as the base powerplant in the C300. It is mated to a 7-speed automatic gearbox. The C300 can be had in standard rear-wheel drive (RWD) or optional 4Matic all-wheel drive (AWD). The C450 AMG comes standard with 4Matic. The rear-drive AMG C63 models use a new 4.0-liter biturbo V8 that makes 469 horsepower or a headier-still 503 in the AMG 63 S.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $39,875 for a base, rear-drive C300 sedan. It’s easy to boost the price closer to $50,000 by adding a $2,700 Premium Package (heated seats, keyless ignition, premium sound), a $2,690 Multimedia Package (rearview camera, navigation). Opt for the C450 AMG ($51,725), and you'll still need to spring $2,880 for leather upholstery. At the top end, the AMG C63 S begins at nearly $74,175. With the Lexus IS sedan starting around $38,000 and the BMW 3 Series under $35,000, that leaves the C-Class on the premium end of the spectrum. But the Mercedes C-Class is expected to have strong resale and residual values, and it won last year’s 2015 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award in the Luxury Car segment.

While the 2016 B250e is all-Benz, it's also a little dull looking; the BMW i3 and even the Nissan LEAF cut more distinctive profiles. Then there's the 88-mile range, which limits the B-Class to around-town excursions only.","For 2016 the Mercedes-Benz B-Class sounds like a smart idea, and a moderately priced EV-only offering from an established luxury automaker should be a win-win. But the B-Class debuted into a market forever changed by the Tesla Model S. Its 88-mile range is small compared to other EVs available, and there's no range-extending gasoline engine as you'll find in a Chevy Volt or BMW i3. The hatchback shape is unique to Mercedes-Benz, but relatively anonymous in traffic. And while the interior offers premium materials, and the 2016 Mercedes-Benz B250e -- as it's now called -- offers a better driving experience than many other EVs, it's more expensive than plug-in hybrids like the Volt and i3, but without the useful range of a base-model Tesla.","Aside from the lack of engine noise, there's nothing unusual about driving the Mercedes-Benz B250e.

RADAR-BASED RECUPERATION SYSTEM
 All electric vehicles have regenerative braking, which adds electricity back to the batteries as you slow down. The 2016 B-Class lets the driver select how aggressive it is, and also integrates the active cruise control to use regen braking to automatically slow the car depending on traffic and road conditions.
 
 VEHICLE HOMEPAGE
 Cars are more connected than ever these days, and the Mercedes-Benz B-Class uses its mbrace app in some interesting ways.

Collision Prevention Assist warns if you're about to rear-end another car; Active Parking Assist helps find a big enough parallel-parking spot; and Attention Assist warns you if you're getting drowsy and recommends taking a break. Safety equipment includes front, side and side-curtain airbags, and a knee airbag for the driver to prevent lower-limb injuries.","Optional Equipment

Other options on the 2016 B-Class EV include blind-spot monitoring to tell you if you're about to change lanes into another car, and lane-keeping assist to nudge you back into the correct lane. Parktronic takes the Parking Assist a step further and actually helps you park the car. The COMAND multimedia system with its 7-inch dash-mounted screen is also optional.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz B250e is actually one of the less expensive Mercedes-Benz models currently available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is about $43,350; add in all the options and you're looking at about $51,000 worth of luxury-branded EV. The best news is that's all before the $7,500 federal incentive, not to mention any local or state incentives, meaning you could get into a fully electric Mercedes for about the same price as a loaded Toyota Camry. Okay, nobody would call that cheap, but the B-Class also qualifies for single-occupant carpool-lane access, a feature worth its weight in gold in congested cities like Los Angeles. That compares well against cars like the BMW i3 and Chevrolet Volt. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what other B-Class buyers in your area are paying.

The 2017 B250e is all-Benz, but it's also a little dull-looking. The BMW i3 and the Nissan LEAF, although no beauties, cut more distinctive profiles, and the new Chevy Bolt offers much more range. The 88-mile range really limits the B-Class to around-town excursions only.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz B-Class, a moderately priced EV from an established luxury automaker should be a winner. But the B-Class debuted into a market forever changed by the Tesla Model S. And the competition has grown since and now includes the more affordable Chevy Bolt, which offers 200-plus miles of range. The 88-mile range of the new Mercedes B250e was already small compared to other EVs available, and it doesn’t offer a range-extending gasoline engine as you'll find in a Chevy Volt or BMW i3, plus the B-Class is more expensive. Although its interior offers premium materials, and the new 2017 B250e offers a better driving experience than many other EVs, the new B-Class needs more style and more range to compete successfully in today’s EV market.","Aside from the complete lack of engine noise, there's nothing unusual about driving the 2017 Mercedes-Benz B250e. The new B-Class accelerates, brakes and handles with all the skill expected of...","Favorite Features 
 
ATTENTION ASSIST
 This unique system, which is standard on the new Mercedes B250e, learns your driving style in the first few minutes of a drive, then, as your journey continues, it continues to check your driving and conditions. If it determines you’ve become drowsy it sounds an alert and encourages you to stop.
 
 VEHICLE HOMEPAGE
 Cars are more connected than ever these days, and the new Mercedes-Benz B-Class uses its mbrace app in some interesting ways. For example, you can program the climate control to heat or cool the vehicle while it's charging, saving the battery for actual driving and not for keeping the car comfortable.","","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz B250e is essentially unchanged from last year’s model; however, its price has been slashed around $500 to about $41,000, which includes a $925 transportation charge.; The 2017 B250e is a nice-looking car, with athletic proportions and modern detailing, but there’s little about the styling that's uniquely Mercedes-Benz. Strip the 3-pointed star from its grille and you'd be hard-pressed to tell this tall 5-door from any number of other European or Japanese","The front-wheel-drive 2017 Mercedes-Benz B250e comes with cruise control, aluminum-alloy wheels, navigation and automatic climate control, power front seats with memory, split-folding rear seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, all pretty mainstream stuff. But there are also all the active-assist features. Collision Prevention Assist warns if you're about to rear-end another car; Active Parking Assist helps find a big enough parallel-parking spot; and Attention Assist warns you if you're getting drowsy and recommends taking a break. Safety equipment includes front, side and side-curtain airbags, and a driver’s knee airbag to prevent lower-limb injuries.","Optional Equipment 
Mercedes’ unique radar-based regenerative-braking system is a must-have. It allows the driver to dial in the level of regenerative braking, and it integrates the active cruise control system to automatically slow the car depending on traffic and conditions. Other options on the B-Class EV include leather upholstery, heated front seats, blind-spot monitoring to tell you if you're about to change lanes into another car, and lane-keeping assist to nudge you back into the correct lane. Parktronic takes the Parking Assist a step further and actually helps you park the car. The COMAND multimedia system with its 7-inch dash-mounted screen is also optional.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz B250e is actually one of the less expensive Mercedes-Benz models currently available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is about $41,000; add in all the options and you're looking at about $51,000 worth of luxury-branded EV. The best news is that's all before the $7,500 federal incentive, not to mention any local or state incentives, meaning you could get into a fully electric Mercedes for about the same price as a loaded Toyota Camry. Okay, nobody would call that cheap, but the new B-Class also qualifies for single-occupant carpool-lane access, a feature worth its weight in gold in congested cities like Los Angeles. That compares well against cars like the BMW i3 and Chevrolet Volt. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what other B-Class buyers in your area are paying.

If your position in life demands driving the best, but you prefer subtle sophistication to flashy flamboyance, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class luxury sedan is your ride. Powerful, plush and packed with the latest automotive technology, this big sedan and 2-door coupe make a statement like no other.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
You can get most of the power, luxury and prestige of an S-Class from a Jaguar XJ, BMW 7 Series or Audi A8, and you’ll pay tens of thousands less. Budget even tighter? How about a Kia K900 or Hyundai Equus.","While many luxury cars claim to be the envy of the world’s elite, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class earns this accolade without any need for clever ads or celebrity endorsements. CEOs and heads of state the world over are attracted by the S-Class’ power, sophistication and attention to detail. While cars like the BMW 7 Series and Lexus LS are impressive, they always seem to be one step behind the S-Class. The big Benz’s technology, driver-assist aids and luxury trappings are second to none, justification enough for its nearly $100,000 base price. In its most elite form, the V12-powered AMG S65 impresses beyond reason, while the eco-friendly super rich can opt for the S550e plug-in hybrid.","Because of the extensive use of aluminum throughout its body, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class luxury sedan feels surprisingly light on its feet, especially given its rather ponderous size.

CIRCUS-QUALITY DAY-SPA OPTIONS 
True luxury means delivering features unheard of in other cars, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class for 2016 delivers such luxury in spades. From its hot-stone massage setting on the multi-contour massaging seats to the glove-box-mounted fragrance atomizer; it’s like sitting in a rolling day spa.","","There are no major changes to the Mercedes Benz S-Class for 2016. The AMG nameplate is now a prefix as opposed to a suffix.; With a tastefully sweeping rear, the 2016 MB S-Class executive sedan is endowed with some of the coupe-like design cues from the 1st-generation CLS to portray a fastback profile. From the blown-back shape of the headlights to the elegant flow of the C-pillar and the converging crease-lines in the profile, the S-Class feels low-slung and finessed without sacrificing any interior roominess or room in the trunk, which holds a generous 16.3 cubic feet of cargo. S600 and AMG variants are distinguished by their dual-tipped exhaust outlets. The coupe version, which rides on a shorter 116-inch wheelbase, is a true pillarless hardtop.","As expected on a car whose price can equal that of a house, standard equipment takes on new meaning in an S-Class, with features that would either be optional or unavailable in other cars. Among the standouts are 16-way-power front seats, 13-speaker Burmester audio system (audiophiles just smiled), navigation system and power rear sunshade. Oh, and we mustn't forget the in-cabin fragrance system that uses replaceable vials of differing aromas. Also standard are all manner of highly advanced safety systems, including autonomous braking at speeds up to 65 mph. Another standard S-Class feature is 24-hour roadside assistance that never expires.","Optional Equipment 
Options for MB’s 2016 S-Class range from the self-indulgent (the massaging, climate-controlled front seats we've personally enjoyed) to the next generation of safe (infrared nighttime-vision display and Distronic Plus with radar-based cruise control and autonomous steering to keep you within lanes). In between are even higher-grade leather seats with headrests so soft they feel like pillows, 4-zone climate control and the mbrace Plus with apps and access to a Mercedes-Benz concierge. For VIPs buying an S-Class sedan for the rear seats, there's the executive seating package, rear-cabin refrigerator, dual-screen entertainment system and power side shades for added privacy.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $96,500 for an S550, or $3,000 more for an all-wheel-drive 4Matic model. The performance-oriented AMG S63 V8 rings in over $144,000, while the V12-powered S600 starts just under $172,000. The most expensive S-Class is the AMG S65 Sedan at nearly $228,000 – before options. Coupes start just under $122,500 for the S550 4Matic and top out at about $237,000 for an AMG S65. At these prices, the 2016 S-Class sedan costs thousands to tens of thousands more than rivals like a V8-powered BMW 7 Series or Audi A8 (starting around $89,000 and $87,000, respectively).

If you want one of the most extreme SUVs money can buy – regardless of price, fuel economy and ride comfort – say hello to the 2016 G-Class. Few luxury SUVs are as brash, and this one has all the capability you could desire to back up its bold looks.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2016 G-Wagen has all the leather, safety features and power you could desire, but it's not very comfortable. A Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne, BMW X5, Audi Q7 and the new Bentley Bentayga ultra-luxury SUV have more refined rides and are easier to live with in general.","As Mercedes-Benz's toughest and most exclusive SUV, the 2016 G-Class has the luxury credentials and cachet that come with a 6-figure SUV, yet retains the essence, style and hardware of ancestors better known for transporting military troops than Hollywood socialites. Also known as the G-Wagen, this is a real-deal off-roader. With triple-locking differentials, a turbocharged V8 and rugged frame, the G-Class could take you to the ends of the earth. But as with luxury SUV rivals like the Range Rover and Lexus LX 570, one can only smile at the irony that 99 percent of its 1-percenter owners will never leave asphalt. Few vehicles exude the bravado of the G-Class, and the new, roughly $220,000 V12-powered AMG G65 takes things to a whole new level.","Good news/bad news: The Mercedes-Benz G-Class will take you anywhere you want to go, from the base of a volcano to the top of Vail, but the ride to either...","Favorite Features 
 
UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE 
Face it: Most SUVs have gone soft, trading their truck-based frames and low-range gearing for sedan-like platforms that drive like, well, sedans. But the G-Class bucks all that to remain much the same as it has for four decades – a bold, sturdy, go-anywhere vehicle. 
 
V12-POWERED AMG G65 
About the only way for Mercedes to make the G-Class even more extreme was to implant it with a twin-turbocharged V12 engine, the way it has done with range-topping vehicles like the S-Class. Mercedes has done just that with the G65, making it one of the few modern V12-powered SUVs.","","If the standard, G550 and higher-end AMG G63 are not excessive enough, plutocrats can opt for the new AMG G65. Costing nearly $220,000, this top-line G-Class boasts a twin-turbo V12 with a prodigious 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The plebian G550, meanwhile, now uses a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8.","Even if you spend the least on a ""base"" G550, you're still getting a luxury SUV befitting its $120,000 price tag. Highlights include power sunroof, dual-zone climate control and Mercedes' COMAND system that bundles navigation, harman/kardon audio system and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Other safety and convenience features include blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, heated and ventilated front seats, and leather and wood interior. Also standard: The intangible confidence/ego gained from driving a vehicle that could crush almost any environment.","Optional Equipment 
The AMG G63 adds a more powerful V8 engine, 20-inch wheels (vs. 19 on the G550), high-performance braking system and sport exhaust and supple Designo wood and leather interior. The King Kong AMG G65 boasts a V12 engine, AMG front seats and Designo-exclusive Nappa leather interior and 21-inch wheels. Other options include a rear-seat entertainment system with twin LCD monitors, heated steering wheel, and electronically adjustable suspension in the G550. Also available are subscriptions to mbrace, Mercedes' suite of mobile apps, concierge and other services.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2016 Mercedes-Benz G-Class luxury SUV is over $120,000 for the G550 and over $140,000 for the AMG G63. The new 2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG 65 starts just shy of $220,000. Add in the AMG Performance Studio Package, and that's another $20,000 alone. At these prices, the G-Wagen is among the most expensive SUVs out there, but those with money to burn can also easily spend $100,000 to even $200,000 on a super-luxe Range Rover or Porsche Cayenne Turbo. The new Bentley Bentayga, also a 12-cylinder SUV, is expected to start well over $200,000. Because even the prosperous enjoy getting the best deal, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new G-Class. The G-Wagen's resale value has traditionally held up well over the years.

If you fancy yourself more Richard Branson than Bill Gates, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the vehicle you’ll want to take on all your exotic adventures. Powerful, luxurious and built to withstand punishment, the G-Class may not get you there as comfortably as a Lexus, but it will get you there.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Despite its luxury name and trappings, Mercedes-Benz’s G-Class for 2017 isn’t as comfortable or safe as a Porsche Cayenne or Bentley Bentayga. If you’re looking for a combination of rugged go-anywhere credentials and the latest in safety and luxury, a 2017 Land Rover Range Rover makes a much better choice.","It may be hard to fathom, but one of Mercedes-Benz’s most expensive and rugged vehicles is also one of its oldest. Now entering its 38th year of production, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV (better known as the G-Wagen) has seen many improvements since the original, but at its core remains the same rugged beast. Not as refined as a Land Rover Range Rover, nor as spacious as a Cadillac Escalade, the 2017 G-Class confounds logic as the go-to vehicle for the ultra-rich wishing to impress their friends and enemies. Of course, most will never need or use the G-Wagen’s abilities. However, those who do venture off-road will find themselves behind the wheel of one of the world’s most capable off-road warriors.","From a capability standpoint, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV for 2017 will take you almost anywhere you want to go, from a secluded sandy beach to the most...","Favorite Features 
 
UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE
 While most luxury SUVs only hint softly at their off-road ability, the 2017 MB G-Class screams it proudly from the highest peak. You won’t find a sedan-like ride or ultra-quiet cabin in the G-Class, but you will find a tenacious off-roader that will make you the envy of the Moab set.
 
 V12-POWERED AMG G65
 The idea of wedding the track-performance genius of AMG with a nearly 40-year-old SUV might seem like lunacy, but we like it. The twin-turbocharged V12 provides more power than any off-roader could ever want, but on the street it simply furthers the G-Class’s cred.","","Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 G-Class luxury SUV gains a new off-road trim dubbed the G550 4x4. This model is raised 17 inches and widened by nine inches and features portal axles, three locking differentials and a permanent all-wheel-drive system. On the standard G-Class, improvements are limited to smartphone, designo and AMG package upgrades.; While even Range Rovers have softened their lines, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class retains the boxy, upright look it has had for decades. Aerodynamic it's not, but the G-Wagen's design is honest, masculine and pragmatic. At just 187.5 inches long, the G is actually shorter than the Mercedes GLE","Even if you spend the least on a ""base"" G550, you're still getting a luxury SUV befitting its $120,000 price tag. Highlights include power sunroof, dual-zone climate control and Mercedes' COMAND system that bundles navigation, harman/kardon audio system and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Other safety and convenience features include blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, heated and ventilated front seats, and leather and wood interior. Also standard: the intangible confidence/ego gained from driving a vehicle that could crush almost any environment.","Optional Equipment 
The AMG G63 adds a more powerful V8 engine, 20-inch wheels (vs. 19 on the G550), high-performance braking system and sport exhaust and supple designo wood and leather interior. The King Kong AMG G65 boasts a V12 engine, AMG front seats and designo-exclusive Nappa leather interior and 21-inch wheels. Other options include a rear-seat entertainment system with twin LCD monitors, heated steering wheel, and electronically adjustable suspension in the G550. Also available are subscriptions to mbrace, Mercedes' suite of mobile apps, concierge and other services.","Pricing Notes

If your next luxury car has to do it all, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz E-Class will likely fit the bill. Excelling in the areas of safety, quality, technology and luxury, the E-Class sedan, wagon, coupe and convertible are all excellent cars in their own right.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
MB’s 2016 E-Class’ subtle styling doesn’t always turn heads and its price tag can induce sticker shock in short order. Cars with more flair and a lower price tag include the Chrysler 300, Hyundai Genesis and Infiniti Q70. We also find the E-Class’ COMAND interface less than user friendly.","When it comes to satisfying the customer, the 2016 E-Class from Mercedes-Benz is the reigning luxury-car champ. Not only does it offer numerous engine and performance options, it does so in a sedan, coupe, convertible and wagon form. Long recognized as the go-to car for the successful elite, the E-Class’ combination of luxury, solidity and quality is hard to beat. Not as expressive or dramatic as a Cadillac CTS or Lexus GS, the E-Class exudes a type of subtle elegance that is both attractive and enviable. The 2016 E-Class also has an excellent reputation for safety, luxury and high resale value. Of course, for those who want something with a bit more bite, there’s the fire-breathing twin-turbo V8 AMG S sedan and wagon.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz E-Class midsize luxury collection offers five engine choices, 10 possible body choices and the option of rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). Delivering impressive comfort and performance,...","Favorite Features 
 
SURROUND-VIEW CAMERA 
Parking in tight spots is stressful, but with the Surround-View camera system on the 2016 E-Class from Mercedes, you’ll get a 360-degree bird’s-eye view from four cameras, ensuring you’ll never dent, ding or bump anything you don’t want to. The E-Class can even park itself, if you like. 
 
THE E63 AMG S MODEL 
Without a doubt, the ultimate E-Class is the ferocious E63 AMG S. With an astounding 577 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, the AMG S upgrade elevates the E-Class to one of the finest performance sedans in the world. And you can have it in wagon form, too.","","For 2016, a number of models are dropped from the line, including the E400; The E-Class for 2016 touts 4-lamp LED headlights set off the nose, which takes on a particularly aggressive form in the Sport version with a large Mercedes-Benz emblem on the grille. No one will ever accuse the E-Class of taking any huge risks design-wise, but for buyers looking for an easily identifiable yet low-key member of the Mercedes family, this premium sedan delivers enough attractive styling cues to make up for its otherwise uncharismatic visual presence. Two-door coupe and convertible models are roughly seven inches shorter than E-Class sedans, highlighted by the lack of a traditional B-pillar between the side windows.","While all E-Class models come standard with Mercedes-Benz’s COMAND multimedia system with Bluetooth, you’ll have to spring for navigation. The usual array of other standard items includes power-adjustable seats, power sunroof and dual-zone climate control, while the AMG models are graced with more luxurious bells and whistles like an active multicontour driver’s seat, and a buttery-soft Alcantara headliner.","Optional Equipment 
While stand-alone items run the gamut from Keyless Go to rear-side airbags, option packages make it easier to combine additional features. The Driver Assist package adds adaptive cruise control, active blind-spot and lane-keeping assist. The Premium package on certain models offers a rearview camera, navigation, satellite radio, heated and ventilated seats, and a harman/kardon Logic7 surround-sound system. Mercedes-Benz’s 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is an option on all variants, except on the E63, where it’s standard. Cabriolet variants can be equipped with the wind-taming Aircap and the Airscarf neck-heating systems.","Pricing Notes

While the E-Class Coupe and Cabriolet continue on as notable premium players in their own right, the enhanced dynamic sophistication, stunning interior redesign and augmented driver assists offered on the all-new Sedan and Wagon arguably qualify them as the safest, smartest and most accommodating offerings on the midsize-luxury scene today.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although the new E-Class Sedan and Wagon add notable visual flair, some may view the Coupe and Cabriolet styling as too conservative. Others might find better value in lower-cost alternatives like a Genesis G80 or an Infiniti Q70. No turbodiesels and -- for now -- just one AMG variant also may irk E-Class loyalists.","This is a transition year for the E-Class that introduces several all-new iterations to the lineup and sees others depart. Totally recast, the 10th-generation Sedan plus its late-arriving E43 AMG 4-door and new Wagon siblings become the most innovative, tech-rich models ever offered, while the Coupe and Cabriolet (detailed here) remain unchanged awaiting a similar transformation due for the 2018 model year. Beyond more sophisticated styling, the 2017 Sedan and Wagon boast a stronger, lighter and slightly larger platform, next-gen interior packaging plus the most advanced selection of safety systems and semi-autonomous driver assists available on any M-B.

 Part of the Premium 3/Driver Assistance Package on the Sedan and Wagon, the Drive Pilot suite of assists blends radar-based Distronic adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping Steering Pilot that keeps the vehicle centered even in a corner, and Speed Limit Pilot that reads and responds to posted signage to provide semi-autonomous capability.
 
 AIR BODY CONTROL SUSPENSION
 A new option on the 2017 E-Class Sedan and Wagon, this multi-chamber adaptive air-suspension setup also includes automatic 4-wheel leveling and ride-height adjustments. It allows the driver to fine-tune the chassis feel to any of three different levels by using the Dynamic Select control that’s standard on all E-Class models.","The passenger compartment of the 2017 E-Class also shows a similar split personality, with the 5-passenger Sedan and 7-passenger Wagon raising the quietness, comfort and overall accommodating ambiance of the 4-place Coupe and Cabrio to a discernably higher plane.

While Premium 1, Premium 2 and Premium 3 Packages that bring increasingly elevated levels of luxury and driver-assist/safety features also are available across the board, several Premium 3 features including semi-autonomous Drive Pilot, Car-to-X connectivity and a Head-up Display are exclusive to the redesigned Sedan and Wagon range.","Under the Hood 
 
Despite the demise of the turbodiesel-4 and twin-turbo AMG V8, the 2017 E-Class offers a broad selection of powertrains. However, for the time being, some are model-specific. The new E300/E300 4Matic Sedan arrives with M-B’s potent and torque-rich 2.0-liter/241-horsepower turbo-4, while the 3.0-liter/329-horsepower twin-turbo V6 fitted to the 2017 E400 4Matic Wagon also carries over in the E400 Coupe and RWD-only E400 Cabriolet variants. The Sedan and Wagon feature M-B’s more efficient 9-speed automatic transmission, but both 2-door models retain the existing 7-speed unit. The Coupe and Convertible continue in RWD-only E550 guise with a 402-horsepower twin-turbo V8, while the sole 2017 AMG-spec E-Class, the new E43 4Matic Sedan, matches its superbly responsive 396-horsepower/3.0-liter biturbo V6 with an AMG-tweaked sport version of the 9-speed automatic.

The 2017 E-Class lineup reshuffle sees the remade E300 Sedan become the new entry-level member of the family, opening at just over $53,000 while the E300 4Matic version kicks off around $55,600. The E400 Coupe commences just below $55,500 with the E400 4Matic starting closer to $58,000 and the E550 bumping that figure close $61,600. Those who favor their E-Class with an al fresco twist will find the E400 and E550 Cabriolet models raise the ante to roughly $63,600 and $70,100, respectively. Pricing for the late-arriving E400 4Matic Wagon starts at $63,300, and E43 AMG Sedan starts at $73,400 are definitely premium, but also retain historically robust E-Class residual values -- although the more heavily-optioned versions are likely to fare less well in the long run.

Love the look and feel of a wagon but not the stigma or limited availability? The 2016 GLA compact-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz is the perfect solution. Available all-wheel drive makes the GLA the perfect year-round companion, while the AMG version should satisfy the most demanding enthusiast.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want a sporty-looking compact-luxury SUV, but you also need the ability to go off-road and carry lots of cargo and people, a Land Rover Evoque, BMW X3 or even a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk makes a better choice.","With compact-luxury crossover SUVs like the BMW X1 and Lexus NX roaming freely, it was only a matter of time before Mercedes-Benz jumped into the fray. With the 2016 GLA, MB has produced a sub-$35,000 compact-luxury crossover SUV that obliterates the field with its stunning good looks, powerful engine options and surprisingly roomy interior. Sharing its engines and underpinnings with the popular CLA sedan, the GLA250 and GLA45 AMG depart from the Audi A3, Land Rover Evoque and BMW X1 by creating a silhouette more wagon-like than SUV. As such, the GLA appeals more to driving enthusiasts with light off-road needs rather than the “outdoor lifestyle” crowd so over-represented in most marketing campaigns.","Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA250 luxury-crossover SUV is the kind of vehicle that prompts fights over who gets the driver’s seat and who rides shotgun, and there’s even more to love when...","Favorite Features 
 
DOWNHILL SPEED REGULATION 
Although you probably won’t be taking the 2016 MB GLA250 to the Rubicon Trail, the standard Hill Descent Control is a nice feature to have when creeping down a snow-covered hill or the occasional dirt trail. 
 
PANORAMA SUNROOF 
A panoramic sunroof can help open an otherwise claustrophobic cabin, but when fitted to a vehicle the size of Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA compact-luxury SUV, it practically makes one feel like they’re driving a convertible.","Though the 2016 GLA luxury-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz feels somewhat coupe-like from the front seats (which is no accident – after all, it’s essentially based on the so-called 4-door- coupe format of the CLA), rear passengers are met with more generous headroom thanks to the GLA’s 3.5-inch-taller SUV profile. As such, this bubble-like greenhouse is bestowed with poplar, burled-walnut or aluminum trim options, which make it feel rather upscale in spite of its accessible price point. Those who won’t spring for leather will get the faux – but convincing – MB-Tex upholstery instead.","You can tell a lot about a car by its available colors, and the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250’s available palette suggests a level of sophistication and maturity that you simply can’t find in other accessible offerings. Early adopters can choose the Edition Orange, of which 750 will be built, as well as a limited Night Package that adds gloss-black trim and black wheels. AMG versions receive the obligatory aggressive body treatment, while an optional Aerodynamics Package goes to 11 with a larger front splitter and a big roof spoiler.","The GLA250 comes with an impressive list of safety items, including collision prevention with autonomous braking and attention assist. Other unexpected standard items include an off-road mode with hill-descent control and a graphical representation of suspension and steering settings with 4Matic versions. Engine stop/start, keyless start and a power liftgate round out the list of off-the-shelf items you might not expect in a reasonably priced Mercedes-Benz.","Optional Equipment 
If you’re smitten with the AMG model’s looks but are stuck with a standard-sized budget, the Sport Package adds meaner bodywork and 19-inch, 5-spoke AMG wheels. Available convenience items include blind-spot assistance, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, and park assist, which helps find a parking spot and takes the reins by steering the GLA into the open space.","Under the Hood 
 
Both of the 2016 GLA’s engine offerings are mated to 7-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The lineup’s powerplants couldn’t be more different in terms of spec, however – the GLA250’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the GLA45 AMG’s yields 355 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque (as well as a more aggressively programmed transmission). The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV is available in front- or in all-wheel-drive 4Matic trim (FWD, AWD). 
 
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (GLA250)

355 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 
332 lb-ft of torque @ 2,250-5,000 rpm 
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/29 mpg","Pricing Notes 
 
In front-drive form, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV starts just under $33,500, with the AWD version about $2,000 above that. At that mark, the GLA represents a solid value considering its quality interior and generous standard equipment. If you don’t mind keeping it somewhat simple by forgoing expensive options, you should be able to purchase a new GLA for less than you might think. The AMG version commands around $50,000, but the sportier model also delivers a fiercer, more mature driving experience. To get a good idea of what others are paying in your area, be sure to check out our Fair Purchase Price. Value should also work in the new GLA’s favor, as Mercedes vehicles tend to hold their value more than most, better than the Lincoln MKC, Audi Q3, Lexus NX and BMW X1, but on par with Land Rover Evoque.

Miss the ride comfort and cargo hauling abilities of small luxury wagon? The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA is just that, only those crafty Germans have disguised it to look like a small-luxury SUV. The AMG version delivers scintillating performance, while 4Matic all-wheel drive can help tackle winter’s worst.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Those seeking actual off-road ability in a small SUV would be better served spending $35,000 on a Subaru Outback, Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk or Land Rover Evoque. Those who prefer the security of carrying a spare tire won’t feel very good about the GLA’s run-flat-only option.","Mercedes-Benz has left its comfort zone to create a radical compact SUV unlike anything before it. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA small-luxury-crossover SUV takes aim at the BMW X1, Infiniti QX30 and Lexus NX, offering Mercedes’ engineering, luxury and performance at a price starting under $34,000. Despite its very un-SUV-like profile, the compact GLA is surprisingly roomy, although you’ll find more cargo and passenger space in an Audi Q3 and Land Rover Evoque. A pair of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines borrowed from the MB CLA sedan supply power to the GLA250 and high-performance Mercedes-AMG GLA45 SUVs. Because of its taut suspensions and low ground clearance, the GLA is more appealing to driving enthusiasts rather than weekend campers needing true off-road ability.","With Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 GLA luxury-crossover SUV, when it comes time to decide who will drive and who will ride shotgun, don’t be surprised if a scuffle ensues.

DOWNHILL SPEED REGULATION
 This feature is nice to have when creeping down slippery inclines or gravel-strewn trails. The 2017 MB GLA’s Hill Descent Control holds the vehicle at a slow set speed so the driver doesn’t have to constantly ride the brake.
 
 PANORAMA SUNROOF
 The Mercedes-Benz GLA for 2017 offers a dual-pane panoramic sunroof so large that when open it makes the GLA feel more like a Jeep Wrangler. A power sunshade keeps things cool in the summer, or can be retracted to let sunlight stream into the cabin.","Though the 2017 GLA luxury-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz feels somewhat coupe-like from the front seats (which is no accident -- after all, it’s essentially based on the so-called 4-door-coupe format of the CLA), rear passengers are met with more generous headroom thanks to the GLA’s 3.5-inch-taller SUV profile.

If you want a small-luxury sedan that is stylish, efficient, and – most of all – a Mercedes-Benz, the CLA-Class can be yours at a price not much higher than that of a mainstream car. Buyers with deeper pockets seeking a sleeper will have a blast in the high-performance AMG CLA45.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The CLA's rear seats are tiny, so if you frequently carry rear passengers or plan to in the future, you may want to make the stretch to a larger model like the C-Class or GLC SUV, or check out the Audi A3 instead.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class is the least expensive car in the German automaker's lineup but packs plenty of features that make it desirable beyond mere badge appeal. Billed as a coupe but in reality a 4-door sedan, the CLA is also among the newest Mercedes models. Like the also-fresh Audi A3, Acura ILX and forthcoming Infiniti Q30, the CLA-Class is positioned to lure young up-and-comers to the luxury brand with its small size and sub-$33,000 starting price. The front- or all-wheel-drive CLA250 is the base model, while the AMG CLA45 is a $50,000, 375-horsepower all-wheel-drive rocket. The CLA has a cramped rear seat and a price that easily ascends, but for aspirational buyers seeking entry into the Mercedes-Benz brand, this is their ticket in.","Much has been made about the CLA250 being Mercedes-Benz's first front-wheel-drive (FWD) car. But the reality is that you'd be hard-pressed to tell what wheels were doing the hard work...","Favorite Features 
 
PANORAMA ROOF 
The snug CLA cabin benefits from the extra glass of the panoramic sunroof option. Open it up, and you're treated to near- convertible levels of sunshine. Alternatively, you can just leave the glass exposed, creating the illusion of additional headroom. 
 
AMG CLA45 4MATIC 
It's anything but cheap, but it's hard not to marvel at the performance numbers of this top-line CLA-Class. With 2016 arrive 20 more horsepower and an additional 18 lb-ft of torque, making a total of 375 horsepower/350 lb-ft – all from a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine.","As we've mentioned, the CLA-Class has a cramped rear seat and isn't the best choice if you regularly carrry more than yourself and a passenger. But we wager this isn't a factor for most shoppers considering the CLA. And they'll find much to like in the front, where a standard 7-inch display, sturdy-looking air vents and a thick steering wheel give an air of elegance. A split-folding rear seat adds versatility to Mercedes' smallest sedan, while the two front seats now offer more comfort with their adjustable cushion length. The standard MB-Tex faux leather seats do a good job mimicking genuine hide.","While it may look like Mercedes-Benz simply took its prettiest sedan – the CLS that Mercedes also calls a coupe – and left it in the dryer too long to create the CLA-Class, there's more to it. Still, the swooping architecture translates well to the smaller car, making it look longer and wider than it really is, at least in isolation. However, the illusion breaks in traffic, when you notice how little of its lane it occupies. The low stance, narrow tires and clean shape give the CLA250 a slip-through-the-air drag coefficient of only 0.23. The new Night Package adds black 18-inch wheels.","Even the least expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan offers many standard features. Among them are dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 12-way-power driver's seat with memory and a brake-hold feature that applies the brake for you at stoplights. The CLA's infotainment system includes AM/FM/HD Radio with CD player, USB port and Bluetooth streaming, all seen and controlled by the 7-inch display and command dial. The CLA250 boasts impressive safety features including systems that detect driver drowsiness (Attention Assist) and Collision Prevention Assist, which uses radar to warn the driver of a potential collision and, if necessary, even applies the brakes for you.","Optional Equipment

You have your choice of engines in Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sedan. The CLA250 gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 208 horsepower, available in either FWD or AWD. The CLA45 AMG version of that engine puts out an astonishing 375 horsepower to all four wheels. The AMG engine is the first 4-cylinder engine from Mercedes-Benz's in-house tuning branch. Both are mated to 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions. At up to 38 mpg, the CLA-Class can be remarkably fuel-efficient, but keep in mind this Mercedes requires premium gasoline.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,000. Add AWD and you're looking at $2,000 more, and when you start adding option packages, this ""inexpensive"" Mercedes-Benz can easily swell toward $40,000. However, at $35,000, you're looking at a lot of car with plenty of options. The CLA45 AMG starts considerably higher, at over $50,000. However, even that is a bargain of sorts, since it's the least expensive AMG-badged model you can get. The Audi A3, a subcompact-luxury rival, starts slightly less than the Mercedes CLA-Class, while the Acura ILX is several thousand below. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's residual value is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.

If you’re seeking a Civic-sized car with an upscale pedigree, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 makes a great choice. Strong performance and impressive handling make this one fun ride, and those with deep pockets will love the performance offered by the AMG CLA45.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need a reasonably sized rear seat and lots of equipment for your $35,000, you’ll be better off looking at a non-luxury brand like the Kia Optima, Chrysler 300 or Nissan Maxima. The CLA-Class may look like a bargain on paper, but adding options quickly moves the price north.","As the least expensive sedan in the automaker’s lineup, one might think the 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class 4-door coupe would be just a bargain-basement ploy to lure customers into the showroom. But, this hot little machine is anything but hype. Designed to take on the Audi A3, Acura ILX and Infiniti Q30, the 2017 CLA-Class can run circles around the competition, with standout styling and a high-performance AMG CLA45 version that pumps out an impressive 375 horsepower. Even the base CLA250 offers plenty to like, with a willing turbocharged engine, available all-wheel drive and a starting price just under $33,400. If you can live with the cramped rear seat and limited visibility, the 2017 MB CLA250 is ideal for first-time luxury-car buyers.","Generations of Mercedes-Benz cars have been pushed by their rear wheels, so the fact that the 2017 CLA250 4-door coupe is pulled by its front tires might seem like a...","Favorite Features 
 
PANORAMA ROOF
 The optional panoramic glass sunroof is a great way to open up the 2017 MB CLA-Class’s snug cabin. When open, the cockpit is filled with fresh air and sunshine. Leave the glass portion closed but with the sunshade retracted, and you’ll gain lots of light while creating a bit more headroom.
 
 AMG CLA45 4MATIC
 For those who can afford the premium, the AMG CLA45 4Matic delivers impressive power, handling and sophistication far better than any Acura ILX, Infiniti Q30 or Audi S3, but on par with the BMW M2.","As we've mentioned, the CLA-Class has a cramped rear seat and isn't the best choice if you regularly carry more than yourself and a passenger. But we wager this isn't a factor for most shoppers considering the CLA. And they'll find much to like in the front, where a standard 7-inch display, sturdy-looking air vents and a thick steering wheel give an air of elegance. A split-folding rear seat adds versatility to Mercedes' smallest sedan, while the two front seats offer more comfort with their adjustable cushion length. The standard MB-Tex faux leather seats do a good job mimicking genuine hide.","While it may look like Mercedes-Benz simply took its prettiest sedan -- the CLS that Mercedes also calls a “coupe” -- and left it in the dryer too long to create the CLA-Class, there's more to it. Still, the swooping architecture translates well to the smaller car, making it look longer and wider than it is, at least in isolation. However, the illusion breaks in traffic, when you notice how little of its lane it occupies. The low stance, narrow tires and clean shape give the CLA250 a slip-through-the-air drag coefficient of only 0.23. The new Night Package adds black 18-inch wheels.","Even the least expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan offers many standard features. Among them are dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 12-way-power driver's seat with memory and a brake-hold feature that applies the brake for you at stoplights. The CLA's infotainment system includes AM/FM/HD Radio with CD player, USB port and Bluetooth streaming, all seen and controlled by the 7-inch display and command dial. The CLA250 boasts impressive safety features including systems that detect driver drowsiness (Attention Assist), a rearview monitor and Active Brake Assist, which uses radar to warn the driver of a potential collision and, if necessary, even applies the brakes.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 CLA-Class offers a plethora of options, most bundled into packages. Most notable are navigation, harman/kardon premium audio, blind-spot monitoring, leather upholstery, heated front seats, smart cruise control, parallel-parking assist, panoramic sunroof, and adaptive suspension. AWD is optional on CLA250 models and standard on the AMG variant. That performance model can be further heightened with the AMG Dynamic Plus Package that raises the top speed to 167 mph, adds a Race Start setting and a limited-slip front differential. Mercedes' mbrace Connect service offers remote access from your phone. Five years' service is complimentary.","Under the Hood 
 
You have your choice of engines in Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sedan. The CLA250 gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 208 horsepower, available in either FWD or AWD. The CLA45 AMG version of that engine puts out an astonishing 375 horsepower to all four wheels. The AMG engine is the first 4-cylinder engine from Mercedes-Benz's in-house tuning branch. Both are mated to 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions. At up to 36 mpg, the CLA-Class can be remarkably fuel-efficient, but keep in mind this Mercedes requires premium gasoline.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (CLA250)
 208 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,000 rpm

 375 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm
 350 lb-ft of torque @ 2,250-5,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,400. Add AWD and you're looking at $2,000 more, and when you start adding option packages, this ""inexpensive"" Mercedes-Benz can easily swell toward $40,000. However, for around $37,000, you're looking at a lot of car with plenty of options. The CLA45 AMG starts considerably higher, around $51,000. However, even that is a bargain of sorts, since it's the least expensive AMG-badged model you can get. The Audi A3, a subcompact-luxury rival, starts slightly less than the Mercedes CLA-Class, while the Acura ILX is several thousand below. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's residual value is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.

Although the CLS’s aging design is holding up well, its usefulness as a sedan is somewhat hampered by a rather cramped rear seat and small trunk.

JEWEL EYE LED HEADLIGHTS 
Acura's ""Jewel Eye"" headlights have become a signature look for the brand, and that's fine by us. Not only do they give the nose of the MDX and other Acura cars a striking appearance, the LED headlights recreate the daylight spectrum for better visibility at night and less eyestrain. 
 
PUSH-BUTTON 3RD-ROW ACCESS 
All 3rd-row access should be this easy. Just push a button on the 2nd-row seat in a new MDX, and it flips and folds quickly, without having to strain, lug or tug. Other SUV manufacturers should take notes.","The new Acura MDX interior carries over from last year, except for the new 9-speed automatic's push-button shifter. Acura's restrained luxury emphasizes comfort and ease-of-use, with luxuriant leather, soft-touch surfaces, and expensive-feeling buttons and switches. It'd be nice if the wood was real, and competitors like the Infiniti QX60 and Audi Q7 have a bit more artistry, but those are minor points. The uncluttered interface is thanks to a pair of LCD displays that perform most operations, and do it well once you get used to the setup. We particularly like how the easy-fold 2nd-row seat.","Acura has abandoned weirdness and returned to its handsome roots, and we should all be thankful. The Jewel Eye headlights are the centerpiece of MDX SUV styling, and while the ""power plenum"" grille still exists, it's nowhere near the gaudy shield that kicked off Acura's in-the-woods styling of the late 2000s. Instead, we get classy, well-proportioned and clean lines that are a definite step forward from the last-generation model. It's also less bulky, meaning that it's easier to maneuver in tight parking places.","For 2016, the Acura MDX lineup technically comes only one way, with various options packages upping the equipment levels and price. The basic MDX comes with the 3.5-liter V6 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission. Beyond that, there are the LED headlights, keyless entry with push-button start, a backup camera, 3-zone climate control, and a power liftgate. You also get heated front seats and an 8-speaker audio system that includes Aha Radio and Pandora. The Acura MDX backs up its 5-star and IIHS Top Safety Pick + crash test ratings with seven airbags, and trailer-sway control on all-wheel-drive models.","Optional Equipment 
Available on all 2016 MDX models is the new AcuraWatch suite of driver-assist technologies, adding adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, collision mitigation braking, lane departure warning, and several other safety systems. On top of that, there's the Technology Package, which includes a multi-view rear camera and navigation; an Advance Package that adds a remote engine start, head-up warning and ""auto idle stop"" (which shuts off the engine when you're at a stoplight to save fuel); and an Entertainment package that adds a rear-seat entertainment system. All-wheel drive is available on every MDX model.","Under the Hood 
 
You get one engine with the new Acura MDX: a 3.5-liter V6 with 290 horsepower, powering either the front or all four wheels. The new 9-speed automatic transmission features a push-button interface rather than a traditional shift lever, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Acura uses several tricks to improve fuel economy, such as Variable Cylinder Management, which shuts down three of the six cylinders during cruising and deceleration to improve economy. MDX models with the Advance Package include auto idle stop to improve the SUV's mpg. Interestingly, though, fuel-economy numbers drop a little bit this year depending on the model, although auto idle stop helps mitigate that a little. We'd still say that fuel economy of up to 27 mpg is still pretty good.

As you add Technology, AcuraWatch, Entertainment, and Advance packages the price climbs to a peak of $56,000 for a front-wheel-drive MDX SUV. Across the board, all-wheel drive adds about $2,000. With a peak price that's less than $60,000, which compares very favorably to competitors like the BMW X5 and Audi Q7, both of which start closer to $50,000 and can easily top $80,000 when fully optioned. The Lexus RX starts for less, but it only seats five, and can't match the MDX when it comes to standard features. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are actually paying for a new MDX. As a long-term investment, the 2015 MDX is expected to maintain some of the highest residual values among luxury SUVs.

If your idea of a luxury car is one that pampers, impresses and occasionally thrills when the road turns winding, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class should prove a very satisfying purchase. Vast improvements in interior design and materials help the 2016 C-Class shed its “entry-level” status.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
While the C-Class’ styling is decidedly less stodgy than MB cars of yore, the chassis and steering feedback still don’t approach that of BMW, Cadillac or Audi cars. Those seeking similar creature comforts but not the lofty price tag might find more to like in a Chrysler 300 or Hyundai Genesis.","The Mercedes-Benz C-Class for 2016 has come into its own, a worthy adversary to cars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. Fresh from a complete redesign last year, the 2016 car is larger, wider, lighter and more posh than previous-generation C-Class sedans. The C-Class offers new levels of luxury on the inside and ever greater performance under the skin, where a new C450 AMG model adds another option to the multifaceted C-Class lineup. And, while we’re pretty sure the C-Class won’t excite BMW autocrossers, it should appeal to those seeking big luxury-car trappings in a body not much bigger than a midsize sedan. Although the C-Class coupe was a carryover from last year, the new coupe will debut as 2017 model.","With the exception of the AMG cars, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class was never known for its stellar athleticism. But, in the 2016 C-Class sedan something is stirring that might begin to...","Favorite Features 
 
AIRMATIC SUSPENSION 
Once a feature found only on high-end Mercedes cars, the Airmatic suspension on the 2016 C-Class sedan helps control the ride and lessen the somewhat harsh feel afforded by the car’s run-flat tires. Four driver-selectable settings include Comfort, ECO, Sport and Sport +. 
 
DRIVER ASSISTANCE PACKAGE 
The Driver Assistance Package on the 2016 C-Class features active lane-keeping and blind-spot assist, available via the adaptive cruise control that makes driving in heavy traffic an effortless affair.","Lovely. Few other words suffice when it comes to describing the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan's interior, especially on the heels of the former generation, which had a cold, clinical demeanor. The C-Class comes available with an attractive array of wood and aluminum finishes, and a relatively clutter-free layout that manages to still feel elegant. Central to the de-cluttering is a simple rotary dial and touch pad that responds to gestural inputs, swipes and handwriting. Adding to the upscale feel is an available Air Balance Package with a fragrance diffuser that atomizes perfume into the air-conditioning system.","At first glance, the Mercedes C-Class bears a strong resemblance to the E-Class and S-Class – and yes, it certainly does borrow cues including the aggressive front grilles, sweeping character lines, and taut rear end. However, the C’s compact proportions give it a more purposeful appearance that’s a bit sterner than the jaunty CLA. If you crave a snazzier look, the 3-pointed star on the grille can be lit up with LEDs for an extra $480, while a Sport package brings more aggressive bodywork and wheels.","The Mercedes-Benz C300 for 2016 features a decent amount of standard equipment, including dual-zone climate control, keyless start and a touch-pad-operated multimedia interface. A rearview camera is bundled into a $2,690 Multimedia Package, though it can be ordered a la carte for $460. Standard items on the C450 AMG get more substantial, including Bluetooth audio streaming, 14-way-power sport seats, AMG adaptive sport suspension, adaptive braking, Collision Prevention Assist and ECO start/stop. Optional features that are standard on most of the C-Class’s competitors include heated seats, navigation and leather upholstery.","Optional Equipment 
There are seemingly endless ways to load up the C-Class’s amenities. Opt for the Interior Package, and you’ll get leather (which you’d think would be standard on a car of this caliber), ventilated seats, and multicolor LED ambient lighting. A Multimedia Package adds an 8.4-inch navigation screen, voice control and a 10-gigabyte music hard drive. The Parking Assist Package ($1,290) adds the Surround View camera and Parktronic w/Active Parking Assist. Airmatic suspension adds $1,190 to the C300’s premium, and if you’re looking for features you never knew you needed, you’ll want the cabin fragrance system for $350.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2016 C-Class sedan from Mercedes comes with a potent turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that acts as the base powerplant in the C300. It is mated to a 7-speed automatic gearbox. The C300 can be had in standard rear-wheel drive (RWD) or optional 4Matic all-wheel drive (AWD). The C450 AMG comes standard with 4Matic. The rear-drive AMG C63 models use a new 4.0-liter biturbo V8 that makes 469 horsepower or a headier-still 503 in the AMG 63 S.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $39,875 for a base, rear-drive C300 sedan. It’s easy to boost the price closer to $50,000 by adding a $2,700 Premium Package (heated seats, keyless ignition, premium sound), a $2,690 Multimedia Package (rearview camera, navigation). Opt for the C450 AMG ($51,725), and you'll still need to spring $2,880 for leather upholstery. At the top end, the AMG C63 S begins at nearly $74,175. With the Lexus IS sedan starting around $38,000 and the BMW 3 Series under $35,000, that leaves the C-Class on the premium end of the spectrum. But the Mercedes C-Class is expected to have strong resale and residual values, and it won last year’s 2015 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award in the Luxury Car segment.

If you wanted something bigger than the GLK, and a little more Mercedes-like in feel, then your patience is rewarded with the 2016 GLC-Class. Alternatively, if you're just in the market for a nice-driving, good-looking, comfortable and nicely equipped midsize-luxury SUV, check it out.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Those looking for more immediate oomph might want to look at the 6-cylinder power available in the BMW X3 and Audi Q5. Also know that features like spacious passenger and cargo room and adaptive cruise control are available from mainstream brands for a fraction of the price.","Replacing the GLK, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class challenges the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and other midsize-luxury SUVs with its style, features, luxury and the kind of driving experience the enormous 3-point star on the nose suggests. It's powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine connected to a new 9-speed automatic transmission, sending 241 horsepower to either the rear or all four wheels. Standard high-tech features include collision avoidance, crosswind assist, keyless ignition and a Dynamic Select control that lets the driver switch between various drive modes. But beyond that, the new GLC is bigger in every dimension, to give more space for passengers, driver and cargo, but also to put more space between it and last year's new addition, the GLA-Class subcompact-luxury SUV.","The new Mercedes-Benz GLC feels a lot like the new C-Class from behind the wheel, and that's a good thing. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and 9-speed automatic...","Favorite Features 
 
AIR BODY CONTROL 
The new air suspension on the 2016 GLC-Class promises a lot. For example, a smoother ride, adjustable ride height when using Sport or Sport+ Dynamic Select modes, and even a ""kneeling"" feature that will allow you to lower the rear of the GLC to make it easier to load cargo. 
 
DESIGNO INTERIOR 
If you have a high bar for a Mercedes-Benz interior – and plenty of money to make it happen – then the available Designo interior on the 2016 GLC is just what you need. Premium leather stitched in a quilt pattern, and even matte-paint finishes are available.","The 2016 GLC is about two inches wider and five inches longer than the GLK, translating to more shoulder room, and an extra 2.2 inches of rear legroom. Cargo room increases by 17 percent, with an easy-to-reach load floor and plenty of storage under the cargo floor, since there's no spare tire taking up room (the GLC uses run-flat tires). There's also a lot more storage space, with a bigger glove box, bigger center console bin and bigger door pockets. The C-Class-inspired dash looks great and is easy to use, and comfortable seating awaits every passenger.","Mercedes’ new GLC-Class is noticeably larger than the GLK, but in a good way. Rather than looking ponderous or unwieldy, it looks substantial and solid, although the smooth curves and soft lines are a little less distinctive than the GLK's sharp creases. Still, there's no arguing that the Mercedes-Benz design aesthetic that debuted on the S-Class translates nicely to this midsize-luxury SUV, and Mercedes-Benz arguably has the best-looking SUV lineup among the big three European luxury brands. Wheel sizes vary from the standard 18 inch to 20 inch, and if you like matte-paint finishes, Designo has you covered.","The 2016 GLC300 offers a solid array of standard equipment. Beyond things like power driver's seat with memory, automatic climate control, power-folding mirrors, a power tailgate and rearview camera, the new GLC-Class comes with things like the Mercedes-Benz touch pad for using the infotainment system. There's also a solid set of safety systems, featuring Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe, which help prevent and mitigate the effects of collisions. Crosswind Assist helps keep the GLC from being blown around by winds. There's also the standard Dynamic Select, which gives drivers driving modes from Eco through Sport+, tailoring throttle and transmission response.","Optional Equipment 
Mercedes-Benz doesn't skimp on the options for its new midsize-luxury SUV, and thanks to various option packages and individual options, you can equip your GLC pretty much any way you want. There's the high-end Designo interior and exterior, of course, but there's also available leather, upgraded wood trims, and a variety of interior colors to choose from. Option packages include a Multimedia package that adds COMAND navigation, a Sport package that gives the GLC an AMG-inspired look, and a driver-assistance package that includes adaptive cruise control, active blind spot and lane-keeping assist and steering assist.","Under the Hood 
 
While a diesel and hybrid model are planned, currently the only engine available in the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Its 241 horsepower is less than the V6 from the GLK it replaces, but with the same 273 lb-ft of torque, a 9-speed automatic transmission, and 200 fewer pounds to deal with, the 2016 GLC300 offers up acceleration that's on par with its predecessor. Rear- and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) are both available, and Mercedes-Benz says the GLC is fully off-road capable, although we'd still recommend taking it easy, as die-hard off-roaders will immediately note the lack of a low-speed transfer case.

A rear-wheel-drive 2016 GLC300 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) under $40,000, while AWD adds $2,000 to the total. That's more than the GLK, but the GLC also adds a considerable amount of standard equipment, making it something of a wash. Options add up quickly though, with some packages – such as the $2,500 interior package with leather upholstery – requiring other packages, in this case, the $1,850 Premium Package. Start adding in Designo upholstery and paint, and you're well on your way to $65,000 for your new GLC-Class. However, more judicious option selection can keep the price right around $50,000, and still retain leather seats, adaptive cruise control and navigation. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. Also, the GLK is a Best Resale Value award winner, and we'd expect the GLC to similarly hold its value.

If you like the Audi ownership experience, but are on a tight budget, an A3 is an obvious choice. Offering more conservative styling than the Mercedes-Benz CLA, but with the luxury pedigree of a decades-old European brand, the Audi A3 also offers the only diesel engine in the class.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2016 Audi A3 is the smallest of Audi's ""Matryoshka-doll"" styling, so it looks like a lot of other Audis out there. The Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan makes a stronger visual statement, the BMW 2 Series Coupe is more fun to drive, and the revamped Acura ILX offers more for the money.","IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle's diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.
 
 Redesigned last year, the Audi A3 entry-luxury Sedan, Cabriolet and new hybrid Sportback e-tron plug-in hatchback are popular choices that offer a combination of affordability and established luxury branding, while boasting Audi’s excellent driving dynamics. Sporty and engaging, the 2016 Audi A3 and performance-oriented S3 models don't feel compromised, despite their relatively low prices. The standard panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights and leather seating only sweeten the deal against rivals like the Mercedes-Benz CLA, and the less-expensive Acura ILX and Buick Verano. Power choices include the standard gasoline engine, a fuel-efficient turbodiesel, a high-performance turbo 4-cylinder in S3 models, and the gasoline/electric combo in the Sportback e-tron. While the Sportback is front-drive only, Quattro AWD is available on most other Sedan and Cabriolet models.","The 2016 Audi A3 comes in four distinct flavors: standard, powerful S3, fuel-friendly TDI diesel, and new gas/electric e-tron plug-in hybrid. However, all share the same basic sense from the...","Favorite Features 
 
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO 
Audi and Bang & Olufsen go hand-in-hand these days, and it's no different when you get to the smaller A3. With 14 speakers and 705 watts, this sweet sounding audio-system upgrade hits the mark. 
 
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP & GO 
Adaptive cruise control systems that automatically adjust speed to the traffic ahead are becoming commonplace. But systems that actually bring the car to a halt in heavy traffic are still rare, especially in lower-priced segments. The 2016 Audi A3 offers it, making your commute that much easier.","Audi has set a high bar with its interiors, with high-style design and immaculate fit and finish. Yet while the 2016 A3 scores well on materials and assembly, it's a little on the bland side compared with other Audi vehicles. That said, it's cleanly designed and suitably sporty, with simple audio and climate controls. We wish the MMI infotainment interface wasn't placed quite so low on the dash though, as it makes it hard to see which button does what until you've learned it by touch. Not surprisingly, rear-seat accommodations are pretty tight, especially for three passengers.","If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2016 A3. Looking a lot like a smaller Audi A6, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels add visual charm to even the least expensive A3. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique sport-oriented styling touches. The short rear deck conceals a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. Convertibles of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power top lowered, while the Sportback offers the added utility of a hatchback configuration.","Newly standard on the 2016 Audi A3 is a backup camera and rear parking sensors, along with heated mirrors and windshield washer nozzles. The backup camera fills in a gap that was conspicuous by its absence in the A3 last year, and we're glad it's finally aboard. Other standard equipment includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro all-wheel drive, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.","Optional Equipment 
If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, heated seats, an excellent Bang & Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology. The last of those includes a clever touch-pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning, and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system comprised of three driving modes: dynamic, comfort and individual.","Under the Hood 
 
Five turbocharged 4-cylinder engine choices confront prospective Audi A3 owners. The base 1.8-liter comes in front-drive Sedans and Convertibles. While capable, it pales next to the more robust 2.0-liter version available with Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive on both body styles. The econo-oriented can opt for a front-drive A3 TDI (sedan only) with a 2.0-liter diesel engine or new Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid with its 1.4-liter engine/electric motor combo. For those seeking more driving thrills, the force-fed 2.0-liter in the Audi S3 (again, Sedan only) puts out a very memorable 292 horsepower to all four wheels. Regardless of engine choice, power is always routed through a 6-speed automatic transmission, as no manual gearbox is available. Also note that all Audi A3 and S3 models use premium fuel.

The base 2016 Audi A3 1.8T opens around $31,000. Opting for Quattro all-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter engine moves that closer to $35,000. The 2016 A3 TDI begins near $34,000, and the open-air Audi A3 Cabriolet starts at about $37,500 for front-wheel drive or $40,500 if you want all-wheel drive. Greenies can get into a Sportback e-tron for $38,825, and the power hungry will gravitate to the $43,500 Audi S3. Be aware that options and trim levels can push pricier variants beyond $50,000. The Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class starts slightly lower, but with less standard equipment. The Acura ILX and Buick Verano are both thousands less, but without the pedigree brand. Check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others paid in your area. As for resale value, the A3 isn't expected to hold up over the long haul as well as the CLA, or even the ILX.

If you like the Audi ownership experience, but are on a tight budget, an A3 is an obvious choice. Offering more conservative styling than the Mercedes-Benz CLA, but with the luxury pedigree of a decades-old European brand, the Audi A3 also offers the only diesel engine in the class.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2016 Audi A3 is the smallest of Audi's ""Matryoshka-doll"" styling, so it looks like a lot of other Audis out there. The Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan makes a stronger visual statement, the BMW 2 Series Coupe is more fun to drive, and the revamped Acura ILX offers more for the money.","IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle's diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.
 
 Redesigned last year, the Audi A3 entry-luxury Sedan, Cabriolet and new hybrid Sportback e-tron plug-in hatchback are popular choices that offer a combination of affordability and established luxury branding, while boasting Audi’s excellent driving dynamics. Sporty and engaging, the 2016 Audi A3 and performance-oriented S3 models don't feel compromised, despite their relatively low prices. The standard panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights and leather seating only sweeten the deal against rivals like the Mercedes-Benz CLA, and the less-expensive Acura ILX and Buick Verano. Power choices include the standard gasoline engine, a fuel-efficient turbodiesel, a high-performance turbo 4-cylinder in S3 models, and the gasoline/electric combo in the Sportback e-tron. While the Sportback is front-drive only, Quattro AWD is available on most other Sedan and Cabriolet models.","The 2016 Audi A3 comes in four distinct flavors: standard, powerful S3, fuel-friendly TDI diesel, and new gas/electric e-tron plug-in hybrid. However, all share the same basic sense from the...","Favorite Features 
 
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO 
Audi and Bang & Olufsen go hand-in-hand these days, and it's no different when you get to the smaller A3. With 14 speakers and 705 watts, this sweet sounding audio-system upgrade hits the mark. 
 
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP & GO 
Adaptive cruise control systems that automatically adjust speed to the traffic ahead are becoming commonplace. But systems that actually bring the car to a halt in heavy traffic are still rare, especially in lower-priced segments. The 2016 Audi A3 offers it, making your commute that much easier.","","After launching the A3 last year, the 2016 A3 ups the ante on standard features, adding a rear-view camera and parking sensors, aluminum-look interior trim, and heated mirrors and windshield-washer nozzles. The plug-in A3 Sportback e-tron hybrid hatchback also joins the lineup.; If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2016 A3. Looking a lot like a smaller Audi A6, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels add visual charm to even the least expensive A3. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique sport-oriented styling touches. The short rear deck conceals a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. Convertibles of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power top lowered, while the Sportback offers the added utility of a hatchback configuration.","Newly standard on the 2016 Audi A3 is a backup camera and rear parking sensors, along with heated mirrors and windshield washer nozzles. The backup camera fills in a gap that was conspicuous by its absence in the A3 last year, and we're glad it's finally aboard. Other standard equipment includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro all-wheel drive, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.","Optional Equipment 
If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, heated seats, an excellent Bang & Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology. The last of those includes a clever touch-pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning, and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system comprised of three driving modes: dynamic, comfort and individual.","Pricing Notes

If style, comfort, safety and superb road manners carry a higher priority on your must-have list than absolute scale and maximum towing capability, the new Audi Q7 – in Premium, Premium Plus or Prestige grade – could well be the new SUV of your dreams.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Buyers whose needs or desires run to having the biggest SUV on the block or one that can tow a trailer that weighs more than the Q7’s outstanding 7,700-lb maximum, would be better off considering a full-size, V8-powered alternative like the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon or Infiniti QX80.","Completely redesigned, the 2017 Audi Q7 has morphed into an outstanding 21st century SUV that delivers more of what today’s buyers are demanding. Sleeker and even more stylish than before, the Q7’s new aluminum-intensive architecture reduces its weight by nearly 500 pounds enhancing fuel efficiency while a new suspension improves ride and handling. Complementing its more contemporary look and feel, Audi’s largest sport utility vehicle also boasts greater interior space for passengers and cargo, plus a host new safety features. Natural rivals to SUVs like the Acura MDX, BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90, all versions of the midsize Q7 share the same 333-horsepower turbocharged gasoline V6 engine backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and Audi’s excellent Quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system.","Already one of the best handling and most fun-to-drive 3-row SUVs on the market, the redesigned 2017 Audi Q7 elevates its driving game to an entirely new level.

AUDI VIRTUAL COCKPIT 
Part of an option group on the Q7 Premium Plus, but standard on the Prestige model, this 12.3-inch fully reconfigurable high-res color digital display integrates the functions of the central multimedia interface (MMI) with the conventional instrumentation to provide the driver with a comprehensive array of vehicle, navigation and infotainment data. 
 
ADAPTIVE AIR SUSPENSION 
Exclusive to the Q7 Premium, Adaptive Air Suspension is part of the Adaptive Chassis Package that also includes 4-wheel steering. Along with improving comfort and control, it can raise ride height 2.4 inches for better off-road ground clearance, and lower it an inch at freeways speeds to help reduce aero drag.","Continuing on in the Audi tradition, the new Q7’s well-appointed cabin boasts a more elegant look and feel highlighted by standard leather upholstery and a recast dash with an A8-style double-inlay design. Logically arrayed controls, a new 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel and highly legible instrumentation – both conventional and the upline Virtual Cockpit display – round out its more user-friendly character. Equally important, the Q7’s new platform expands interior volume and cargo space, adding more appeal to a new 35/30/35 split-tumble flat-folding 2nd-row bench and bigger, power-activated 50/50 3rd-row seat while boosting stow capacity behind the third row from 10.9 to 14.8 cubic feet.","Although exterior dimensions and wheelbase on the Gen II Q7 have decreased marginally, this all-new iteration puts a more sophisticated visual spin on the SUV formula while imparting an even sleeker character that brings an impressively low 0.32 coefficient of drag. The curbside appeal of the new Q7 is further enhanced by a new 3D-look Singleframe grille, edgier fascia treatments and bolder front/rear lighting graphics set off by 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels on the Premium/Premium Plus and 20-inchers on the Q7 Prestige with optional Audi Sport 21-inch rims on offer.","Highlighting the Q7’s expanded roster of standard features are numerous primo touches including leather upholstery, tri-zone climate control, an enhanced MMI radio with retractable 7.0-inch center display, multi-mode Audi Drive Select, a 2-panel panoramic sunroof, 35/30/35 2nd-row bench seats, a power 50/50 folding rear seat, and a programmable power liftgate. Audi Pre Sense basic, Pre Sense City (with pedestrian and vehicle collision warning plus automatic brake initiation) and front/rear parking assist are also found on all Q7s. The Premium Plus version adds things like MMI Navigation and a hands-free tailgate, while the Prestige brings 3D Bose Surround Sound, head-up display, LED headlights, 4-zone air conditioning, and a 360-degree camera.","Optional Equipment 
As you’d expect of any luxury SUV, the Q7 also offers an impressive list of upgrades. Key extras include MMI Navigation Plus with voice control and all-in-touch handwriting recognition, smartphone integration via Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, a Rear-Seat Entertainment Package, Bose as well as Bang & Olufsen premium audio upgrades, Night Vision Assistant, a Vision Package (with full LED lighting and Audi’s fully digital instrument cluster, Virtual Cockpit), plus a Driver Assistance Package (adaptive Cruise Control and Active Lane Assist). The Q7 Prestige also can be had with a Luxury Package (Valcona leather/Alcantara trim) and the Adaptive Chassis Package that brings full air suspension and 4-wheel steering.","Under the Hood 
 
While Audi admits a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline 4-cylinder and a 3.0-liter TDI turbodiesel are slated to put in an appearance at some future date, initially the new Q7 comes with the existing supercharged 3.0-liter gas-fired V6 that continues to make 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Mated to a responsive, paddle-shiftable 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission teamed with Audi’s Quattro AWD system, the engine takes this handsome and notably lighter hauler from 0-60 mph in a claimed 5.7 seconds, gives it a stellar 7,700-pound towing capability, and earns 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway fuel economy numbers from the EPA compared to the 16/22 comparative stats of the previous-generation Q7 with the same powertrain. 
 
3.0-liter supercharged V6 
333 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm 
325 lb-ft of torque @ 2,900-5,300 rpm 
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/25 mpg (8-speed automatic)","Pricing Notes 
 
After sitting out the 2016 season, the all-new 2017 Audi Q7 returns as a significantly better – but also more expensive – SUV for 2017. The Premium now opens at just under $56,000 – about $5,000 more than its 2015 counterpart – with the Premium Plus starting slightly below $60,000 and the Prestige commencing closer to $65,500, but maxing out around $80,000 when fully loaded with extras like the Luxury Package, Bang & Olufsen sound system, rear-seat entertainment setup, and Adaptive Chassis Package. Those numbers put the entry-level 2017 Q7 in line with the 5-passenger BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class as well as the 7-passenger Volvo XC90 although they do make it significantly more expensive than the Acura MDX that also seats seven. While Kelley Blue Book has not yet finalized cost-to-own and residual value figures for the new-gen 2017 Q7, resale value expected to remain a notable plus for the vehicle.

If you want a 3-row luxury SUV with standout safety features, a long list of amenities, plenty of power and a solid reputation, the 2017 Acura MDX is a smart choice. The new hybrid MDX arriving later should appeal to those seeking all that and higher fuel efficiency, too.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
There are many well-equipped 3-row crossover SUVs on the market that can compare to the MDX but cost less than the Acura's roughly $45,000 starting point, including its own cousin the Honda Pilot. Unfortunately, last year's switch to a 9-speed transmission barely helped EPA-rated fuel economy and actually hurt drive quality.","With its versatility, reputation for reliability and value for the dollar, it's easy to see why the Acura MDX is a bestseller among 3-row luxury SUVs. Acura's flagship crossover SUV upped its game just a few years ago when it entered its third generation, offering impressive interior space and semi-autonomous driving features. Now, the 2017 MDX is significantly refreshed with new exterior styling, a host of safety and driving aids, and a forthcoming hybrid model. The MDX continues to employ a powerful V6 engine, but we found last year's move to a 9-speed gear-shifter not the smoothest compared to the transmissions in rivals like the Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 or Infiniti QX60. That issue aside, the Acura MDX offers even more to like for 2017.","For 2017, the Acura MDX retains its strong V6, which provides plenty of power to complement this luxury SUV's agile-yet-comfortable manners. But in our experience, the new 9-speed transmission takes...","Favorite Features 
 
AcuraWatch
 This generation MDX's safety and driving aids have always been strong, and for 2017 Acura is upping the ante with AcuraWatch. Standard on every 2017 MDX, it includes automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and road-departure mitigation, plus adaptive cruise control. These features often run thousands extra in rivals.
 
 PUSH-BUTTON 3RD-ROW ACCESS
 All 3rd-row access should be this easy. Just push a button on the 2nd-row seat in a new MDX, and it flips and folds quickly to provide access to the pair of seats in the rear without having to strain, lug or tug. Other SUV manufacturers should take notes.","","A host of updates for the 2017 Acura MDX includes the standard AcuraWatch suite of safety and driver-assist technology, restyled exterior including a new grille, and luxurious 6-passenger seating in top-line MDX Advance trims. The Acura MDX Sport Hybrid is set to join the lineup later in the model year.; The 2017 MDX is the first production model to sport Acura's new face, a diamond pentagon grille that replaces the former model's snout. It looks stronger and more cohesive. This 3-row luxury SUV's hood, front fenders and ""Jewel Eye"" headlights have been refreshed, as has the rear bumper. The sporty, dual exhaust outlets now feature a bright exterior finish. The MDX's sloping window frame gives the rear of this crossover SUV a coupe-like look, but it makes good use of space. Higher trims now roll on 20-inch wheels, while standard models use 18-inchers. A capless fuel filler means no more unscrewing a cap.","The 2017 Acura MDX is surprisingly well-equipped out the gate. A standard model comes with the AcuraWatch suite of safety and semi-autonomous driving features, leather interior, power-operated and heated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, power tailgate, power moonroof and the HomeLink garage-door opener. On the audio/entertainment front, the MDX comes with an 8-speaker AM/FM/CD system with multiple USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity. The MDX features Siri Eyes Free compatibility for iPhone users, but not CarPlay or Android Auto. Safety and driving features include rearview camera, lane-keep assist and road-departure mitigation, automatic emergency braking, and traction and stability control systems.","Optional Equipment 
Aside from all-wheel drive, most major options are bundled into packages. The Technology package includes navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, Siri Eyes Free, 20-inch wheels and remote engine start. The Advance package adds the 2nd-row captain's chairs, upgraded leather, ventilated front seats, surround-view camera and front/rear parking sensors. A rear-seat entertainment package brings an entertainment screen, wireless headphones, rear-door sunshades and heated 2nd-row seats. Note that this package comes with a 2nd-row bench, so if you want an Advance model with seating for seven, you'll have to add the Entertainment package as well.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Acura MDX has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $45,000 when including the destination charge. All-wheel drive is an additional $2,000, and adding packages can lift prices several thousand more. A fully loaded 2017 MDX can approach $60,000. These prices are nearly in line with rivals like the Infiniti QX60 and Volvo XC90, and below competitors like the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLS. Pricing for the MDX hybrid will be available closer to its launch. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying.

Employing the car’s adaptive cruise control, this system helps keep the C-Class from drifting out of its lane should the driver become inattentive or distracted.","Lovely. Few other words suffice when it comes to describing the 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan and coupe interiors, especially on the heels of the former generation, which had a cold, clinical demeanor. The C-Class comes available with an attractive array of wood and aluminum finishes, and a relatively clutter-free layout that manages to still feel elegant. Central to the de-cluttering is a simple rotary dial and a touch pad that responds to gestural inputs, swipes and handwriting. Adding to the upscale feel is an available Air Balance Package with a fragrance diffuser that atomizes perfume into the air-conditioning system.","At first glance, the Mercedes C-Class for 2017 bears a strong resemblance to the E-Class and S-Class -- and yes, it does borrow the aggressive front grilles, sweeping character lines, and taut rear ends. However, the C’s compact proportions give it a more purposeful appearance. If you crave a snazzier look, the 3-pointed star on the grille can be lit up with LEDs for an extra $480, while a Sport package brings more aggressive bodywork and wheels. The","The Mercedes-Benz C300 for 2017 features a decent amount of standard equipment, including dual-zone climate control, keyless start and a touch-pad-operated multimedia interface. The 300 Cabriolet features a power-retractable soft top, AIRSCARF, heated front seats and 18-inch wheels. Standard items on the new Mercedes-AMG C43 get more substantial, including Bluetooth audio streaming, 14-way-power sport seats, AMG adaptive sport suspension, adaptive braking, Collision Prevention Assist and ECO start/stop. Optional features that are standard on most of the C-Class sedan’s competitors include heated seats, navigation and leather upholstery.","Optional Equipment 
There are seemingly endless ways to load up the C-Class’s amenities. Opt for the Interior Package, and you’ll get leather (which you’d think would be standard on a car of this caliber), ventilated seats, and multicolor LED ambient lighting.

The 2017 C-Class from Mercedes comes with a potent turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that acts as the base powerplant in the C300 sedan, coupe and convertible. It is mated to a 7-speed automatic gearbox. The C300 can be had in standard rear-wheel drive (RWD) or optional 4Matic all-wheel drive (AWD). The new C43 models come standard with 4Matic. The rear-drive AMG C63 models use a 4.0-liter biturbo V8 that makes 469 horsepower or a headier-still 503 in the AMG C63 S. The C350e plug-in hybrid puts out a combined 275 horsepower from its 4-cylinder gasoline engine and 60kW electric motor.

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting right around $40,000 for a base, rear-drive C300 sedan. The C300 Coupe starts closer to $43,500, while the C300 4MATIC pushes past the $45,500 mark. At the high end, the AMG C63 starts at about $75,000. Bridging that gap in price and performance is the Mercedes-AMG C43 at around $52,000, although you'll still need to spring $2,880 for leather upholstery. With the Lexus IS sedan starting around $38,000 and the BMW 3 Series under $35,000, that leaves the C-Class on the premium end of the spectrum. But the Mercedes C-Class is expected to have strong resale and residual values, and it won 2015’s Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award in the Luxury Car segment.

If you’re looking for a sleek modern midsize-luxury SUV, but can’t sacrifice function for form, the 2017 MB GLC-Class may be exactly what you’ve been looking for. Mercedes-Benz’s best safety features are all here, as is its reputation for strong resale and reliability.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re not a fan of 4-cylinder engines, the Audi Q5 and BMW X5 offer a V6, as does the Lexus RX 350. If you want the latest driver assists and infotainment, you can find them in less expensive cars like the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Subaru Outback Touring.","In a field filled with midsize-luxury SUVs like the Audi Q5 and BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 GLC-Class is a formidable player. Its sleek body is a departure from the angular Mercedes SUVs of the past, and its interior sets a new standard for design and execution. In its most demure form, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 241 horsepower. Connected to a 9-speed automatic, this engine delivers both power and economy worthy of the 3-pointed star. However, if that’s not good enough, there’s the new AMG GLC43 that cranks out 362 horsepower. Need something a bit more personal? The GLC Coupe has a more rounded silhouette while retaining the convenience of having four doors.","From behind the wheel, it’s not hard to feel a big dose of the C-Class in the GLC300’s ride and handling characteristics. Acceleration is strong and steady, if not swift,...","Favorite Features 
 
AIR BODY CONTROL
 With the air-suspension setup in the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class luxury SUV, you’ll get a softer ride, the ability to raise or lower the vehicle’s ride height via the Dynamic Select Mode and even have the ability make the GLC “kneel” for easier loading of cargo or pets.
 
 DESIGNO INTERIOR
 Luxury used to be defined by leather seats and power windows, but not anymore. If you truly want your 2017 GLC to stand out in a crowd, the Designo interior option weds leather, color and quilted seat patterns to create an interior that is truly sumptuous, not to mention expensive.","The 2017 GLC is about two inches wider and five inches longer than the old GLK it replaced last year, translating to more shoulder room, and an extra 2.2 inches of rear legroom. Cargo room increases by 17 percent, with an easy-to-reach load floor and plenty of storage under the cargo floor, since there's no spare tire taking up room (the GLC uses run-flat tires). There's also a lot more storage space, with a bigger glove box, bigger center console bin and bigger door pockets. The C-Class-inspired dash looks great and is easy to use, and comfortable seating awaits every passenger.","Mercedes’ GLC-Class for 2017 is bigger than it looks, but in a good way. Rather than looking ponderous or unwieldy, it looks substantial and solid, although the smooth curves and soft lines are a little less distinctive than Mercedes’ previous crisp-edge styling language. Still, there's no arguing that the","The 2017 GLC300 offers a solid array of standard equipment. Beyond the power driver's seat with memory, automatic climate control, power-folding mirrors, a power tailgate and rearview camera, the GLC-Class comes with things like the Mercedes-Benz touch pad for using the infotainment system. There's a solid set of safety systems, featuring Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe, which help prevent and mitigate the effects of collisions. Crosswind Assist helps keep the GLC from being blown around by winds. The GLC Coupe adds 4Matic all-wheel drive and a power sunroof, while the AMG trim gains a twin-turbo V6, Keyless-Go and an AMG-tuned suspension.","Optional Equipment 
Mercedes-Benz doesn't skimp on the options for its latest midsize-luxury SUV, with plentiful option packages that let you equip your GLC pretty much any way you want. There's the high-end Designo interior and exterior, of course, but there's also available leather, upgraded wood trims, and a variety of interior colors to choose from. Option packages include the Premium 2 package that adds COMAND navigation, a Sport package that gives the GLC300 an AMG-inspired look, and a driver-assistance package that includes adaptive cruise control, active blind-spot and lane-keeping assist and steering assist. On top of it all, there's the high-spirited AMG GLC43 model.","Under the Hood 
 
While diesel and hybrid models are planned, currently there are only two engines available for the GLC-Class. In the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder produces a healthy 241 horsepower and can be had with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). Mercedes-Benz says the GLC is fully off-road capable, although we'd still recommend taking it easy, as die-hard off-roaders will immediately note the lack of a low-speed transfer case. The GLC300 Coupe comes standard with 4Matic all-wheel drive, while the AMG GLC43 ups the ante with a 362-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6 teamed with 4Matic.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (GLC300, Coupe)
 241 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg (RWD), 21/28 mpg (AWD)
 
 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (AMG GLC43)
 362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm
 384 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-4,500 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/24
 
Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
A rear-wheel-drive 2017 GLC300 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $40,000, while AWD adds $2,000 to the total. Options add up quickly though, with some packages -- such as the $2,500 interior package with leather upholstery -- requiring other packages, in this case, the $1,830 Premium Package. Start adding in Designo upholstery and paint, and you're well on your way to $65,000. However, more judicious option selection can keep the price right around $50,000, and still retain leather seats, adaptive cruise control and navigation. The AMG GLC43 starts around $56,000. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, the GLC300 holds its value well, slightly better than the Audi Q5, much better than the BMW X5 but still well behind the Lexus RX350.

Check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new C-Class.

If you like the Audi ownership experience, but are on a tight budget, an A3 is an obvious choice. Offering more conservative styling than the Mercedes-Benz CLA, but with the luxury pedigree of a decades-old European brand, the Audi A3 also offers the only diesel engine in the class.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2016 Audi A3 is the smallest of Audi's ""Matryoshka-doll"" styling, so it looks like a lot of other Audis out there. The Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan makes a stronger visual statement, the BMW 2 Series Coupe is more fun to drive, and the revamped Acura ILX offers more for the money.","IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle's diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.
 
 Redesigned last year, the Audi A3 entry-luxury Sedan, Cabriolet and new hybrid Sportback e-tron plug-in hatchback are popular choices that offer a combination of affordability and established luxury branding, while boasting Audi’s excellent driving dynamics. Sporty and engaging, the 2016 Audi A3 and performance-oriented S3 models don't feel compromised, despite their relatively low prices. The standard panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights and leather seating only sweeten the deal against rivals like the Mercedes-Benz CLA, and the less-expensive Acura ILX and Buick Verano. Power choices include the standard gasoline engine, a fuel-efficient turbodiesel, a high-performance turbo 4-cylinder in S3 models, and the gasoline/electric combo in the Sportback e-tron. While the Sportback is front-drive only, Quattro AWD is available on most other Sedan and Cabriolet models.","The 2016 Audi A3 comes in four distinct flavors: standard, powerful S3, fuel-friendly TDI diesel, and new gas/electric e-tron plug-in hybrid. However, all share the same basic sense from the...","Favorite Features 
 
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO 
Audi and Bang & Olufsen go hand-in-hand these days, and it's no different when you get to the smaller A3. With 14 speakers and 705 watts, this sweet sounding audio-system upgrade hits the mark. 
 
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP & GO 
Adaptive cruise control systems that automatically adjust speed to the traffic ahead are becoming commonplace. But systems that actually bring the car to a halt in heavy traffic are still rare, especially in lower-priced segments. The 2016 Audi A3 offers it, making your commute that much easier.","","After launching the A3 last year, the 2016 A3 ups the ante on standard features, adding a rear-view camera and parking sensors, aluminum-look interior trim, and heated mirrors and windshield-washer nozzles. The plug-in A3 Sportback e-tron hybrid hatchback also joins the lineup.; If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2016 A3. Looking a lot like a smaller Audi A6, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels add visual charm to even the least expensive A3. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique sport-oriented styling touches. The short rear deck conceals a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. Convertibles of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power top lowered, while the Sportback offers the added utility of a hatchback configuration.","Newly standard on the 2016 Audi A3 is a backup camera and rear parking sensors, along with heated mirrors and windshield washer nozzles. The backup camera fills in a gap that was conspicuous by its absence in the A3 last year, and we're glad it's finally aboard. Other standard equipment includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro all-wheel drive, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.","Optional Equipment 
If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, heated seats, an excellent Bang & Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology. The last of those includes a clever touch-pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning, and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system comprised of three driving modes: dynamic, comfort and individual.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base 2016 Audi A3 1.8T opens around $31,000. Opting for Quattro all-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter engine moves that closer to $35,000. The 2016 A3 TDI begins near $34,000, and the open-air Audi A3 Cabriolet starts at about $37,500 for front-wheel drive or $40,500 if you want all-wheel drive. Greenies can get into a Sportback e-tron for $38,825, and the power hungry will gravitate to the $43,500 Audi S3. Be aware that options and trim levels can push pricier variants beyond $50,000. The Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class starts slightly lower, but with less standard equipment. The Acura ILX and Buick Verano are both thousands less, but without the pedigree brand. Check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others paid in your area. As for resale value, the A3 isn't expected to hold up over the long haul as well as the CLA, or even the ILX.

If your next SUV needs to be as adept on the road as the best sports sedan, BMW’s 2016 X5 SUV tops a very short list of potential candidate. With a wide variety of powertrain options, there’s an X5 for just about anyone willing to spend $50,000 or more.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for a luxury SUV with a smooth ride and a lower price tag, a better choice might be the Lexus RX 350, Acura MDX or Audi Q7. If you need a roomy, useful 3rd-row seat, a larger Mercedes-Benz GL or Infiniti QX80 might be worth a look.","Although the 2016 BMW X5 is branded by the company as a “sports-activity vehicle” or SAV, for simplicity’s sake we’ll just lump it in with such equally capable SUVs as the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes-Benz GLE. However, there’s no denying the X5 places a big emphasis on the “sport” part of sport-utility vehicle, offering an impressive lineup that includes a plug-in hybrid, diesel model and high-performance M variant. Though it has grown slightly in size, the X5 remains manageable and delivers big in the areas of room, economy and performance. While it certainly is the master of the paved road, the pricey X5 still takes a back seat to such off-road champs as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.","For 2016, the BMW X5 offers five engine choices each with varying fuel economy and acceleration times, but not one of which we’d consider a slug.

INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM 
BMW’s 2016 X5 crossover SUV uses a large 10.2-inch display screen and an intuitive user interface. The large screen makes it easy to find and activate various icons, not to mention delivering a razor-sharp image when hooked up to the available rearview camera. 
 
STEERING FEEL 
Two of the things that make a BMW a BMW are its taut handling and precise steering. If you’re the type who loves to tackle tight turns and feel like you are one with the car, the X5’s direct steering feel and immediate feedback are addicting.","","For 2016, a new X5 xDrive40e plug-in hybrid joins the lineup, providing up to 13 miles of pure electric driving enjoyment and fuel-economy estimates up to 56 mpge.; When we first laid eyes on BMW’s X5 SUV from a distance, we thought we were looking at its smaller brother, the X3. It turned out to be an illusion, and a good one. Though dimensionally the same size as the last generation, the 2016 X5's fresh design makes it appear sleeker and less bloated. In front, BWM's famed ""kidney"" grille design now flows into the headlight housings, while the X5's rear is the first of the brand to feature ""Aero Blades,"" which channel air for better aerodynamics. Pragmatically, the X5 comes with roof rails and a 2-section tailgate.","Spend the least on a 2016 BMW X5 sDrive35i, and you'll find plenty to like, but a few things are still missing for your roughly $55,000. Making the list are 10-way-power and heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, navigation with a 10.2-inch high-res screen, a power tailgate, power-adjustable steering column, 9-speaker audio system with HD Radio, and xenon adaptive headlights. Unexpectedly, leather seating and a rearview camera cost extra. The top-line X5 xDrive50i models add the leather and rearview camera along with 19-inch wheels and luxurious, 20-way-power front seats. Four years/50,000 miles of complimentary maintenance is also standard.","Optional Equipment 
Whether you want a heated steering wheel and ventilated seats or a night-vision assist system, options and packages come in abundance for the 2016 X5. To start off the configuration process, BMW offers three optional ""lines"" – Luxury, xLine and M Sport. The first two bundle aesthetic upgrades and 19-inch wheels, while the M Sport adds performance-oriented features such as steering-wheel-mounted gear shifters and launch control for high-speed takeoffs. Our ears were very pleased with the up-level harman/kardon 600-watt/16-speaker sound system. Those craving extreme sound can get it in a Bang & Olufsen system boasting 1,200 watts.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 BMW X5 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $54,895 for the RWD sDrive35i. The diesel-powered xDrive35d starts at $58,695, while the xDrive40e starts at $63,095. The V8-powered xDrive50i is priced at $71,695 and the X5 M comes in just over $100,000. Adding options can swell these prices by thousands. At its base price, the BMW’s X5 SUV for 2016 is a few thousand dollars above the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz GLE and about $10,000 below the 7-passenger GL-Class. Coming in several thousand below the X5 are the Audi Q7, Infiniti QX60 and QX70, Acura MDX, Lexus RX and Porsche Cayenne. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The X5's predicted resale value is expected to remain very good, on par with Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, better than the Land Rover but still behind the Lexus RX.

This model essentially created the segment when it debuted in the late 1990s. Nearly two decades later, the RX has become Lexus’ best-selling vehicle and a benchmark for rivals such as the Acura MDX, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Cadillac SRX and Lincoln MKX. All new and now in its 4th-generation, the 2016 Lexus RX features a bold exterior design, revamped interior, and new safety and technology features. As with previous generations, the standard RX 350 employs a velvety V6, while the RX 450h is a fuel-efficient gasoline-electric hybrid. F Sport variants have sharper driving dynamics, but the RX’s best traits remain its quiet, composed manners.","While the new Lexus RX’s exterior styling screams aggressiveness, its driving manners remain much as they have been: comfortable, quiet and confident.

“USE THE FORCE” LIFTGATE 
Many automakers offer hands-free liftgates, but they often involve using a kicking motion or some other potentially-silly looking movement. The new Lexus RX offers its own twist. The Touch-Free Back Door option makes it go presto by merely placing a hand near the Lexus badge. You can be discreet or go full Yoda. 
 
LEXUS RX 450H F SPORT 
With the F Sport package now available on Lexus RX hybrid models, you don’t have to choose between high fuel efficiency and more dynamic driving manners. And just like the RX 350 F Sport, it comes standard with traction-enhancing all-wheel drive.","The 2016 Lexus RX interior boasts its own new style. Among the biggest changes is gear selector placement, which abandons its long-held position in the center dash to a more traditional spot in the console below. This opens space in the dash for easy-to-access climate and audio controls. The mouse controller just south of the gear selector is easier to operate. The seats are plush, and there is plenty of legroom in back. Beware of rear blind spots from the new roof design. Cargo space is impressive, with over 18 cubic feet behind the rear seats. That number expands to over 56 cubic feet with rear seats folded.","Terms like “bold,” “aggressive” and “highly-styled” all describe the new Lexus RX’s look. “Polarizing” is another. Keeping with the rest of the Lexus lineup, it begins with a gaping “spindle” grille up front, fluid headlight housings with LED lights, a high beltline, and the 2016 RX’s most divisive element: a flowing, blacked-out C-pillar behind the rear windows.

The standard infotainment system includes an 8-inch command screen, 9-speaker audio with USB, Bluetooth, Micro SD card slot and auxiliary input, and Siri Eyes Free for Apple iPhones. One especially neat feature is Cache Radio, which lets you pause and record 10 minutes’ worth of live radio.","Optional Equipment 
Both the Lexus RX 350 and the RX 450h hybrid can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD). Other options include leather seating, a power moonroof, a heated steering wheel, heated/ventilated front seats, the touch-free tailgate, navigation, an upgraded 12.3-inch display, and a fantastic-sounding 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system. F Sport models add AWD, 20-inch wheels, paddle shifters, adaptive variable suspension, and unique front and rear fascias. Optional safety and driving aids include a pre-collision warning system with pedestrian detection, radar-based cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure alert. A rear-seat entertainment system with DVD player and dual screens is also available.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2016 RX 350 uses Lexus’ tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6. The engine has been enhanced with new cylinder-head design, reshaped intake ports and more. The result is a bump in horsepower – from 270 to 295, and improved fuel economy of up to 26 mpg. Unlike some luxury SUV rivals, this one runs just fine on regular 87-octane unleaded gasoline. The most efficient Lexus RX remains the 450h hybrid, which pairs the 3.5-liter V6 with a battery-electric powertrain. Like a standard Prius, no plugging in is required, but premium unleaded gasoline is recommended. The 2016 RX 450h has total output of 308 horsepower and delivers up to 31 mpg. The Lexus RX’s towing capacity is 3,500 pounds. Hybrid models have the same rating, but towing is meant for AWD models.

The 2016 Lexus RX 350 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $43,000 for a front-wheel-drive model. All-wheel drive costs an additional $1,400, while the Lexus RX 350 F Sport, which comes with AWD, begins just over $50,000. Hybrid Lexus RX 450h models begin just over $53,000. The priciest Lexus RX is the 450h F Sport, which starts just under $58,000. Adding options to any of these models can increase the bottom line by thousands. At these prices, the Lexus continues to significantly undercut German rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE and BMW X5. It is in line with the 3-row Acura MDX, and above the starting prices of the Lincoln MKX, Volvo XC60 and Infiniti QX50.

Buyers seeking a contemporary, comfortable and richly appointed 7-seat AWD vehicle that also delivers outstanding fuel economy, exceptional comfort and world-class safety will find much to like in the new Volvo XC90.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although the new XC90 has grown more spacious, the Infiniti QX60 SUV offers greater overall passenger room while those seeking maximum towing capacity will find it in the Audi Q7. Despite its generous 9.3 inches of ground clearance, the XC90 is still more at home dealing with light-duty trail running than hard-core off-road excursions.","Representing its most ambitious vehicle design program in decades, Volvo’s all-new 2016 XC90 has been recast from the ground up. Marginally larger and more spacious than its highly successful predecessor, this 7-passenger all-wheel-drive (AWD) crossover SUV brings an elevated level of sophistication to its styling, engineering and powertrain elements while introducing class-leading advances in safety and infotainment technologies. As the first vehicle spun from Volvo’s new scalable product architecture (SPA), it aims to steal share from premium global rivals like the Acura MDX, Audi Q7, BMW X5, Infiniti QX60, and Mercedes-Benz M-Class/GLE-Class. Both the XC90 T6 and its T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid sibling also set peer precedent as the result of their extremely efficient, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter/4-cylinder Drive-E gasoline engines.","The 2016 Volvo XC90 moves a notable step beyond the vehicle it replaces on every dynamic level. Matching a lighter but stronger SPA structure with a new double-wishbone-front/multilink-rear chassis setup...","Favorite Features 
 
SENSUS TOUCH CONTROL INTERFACE 
Using a 9.0-inch high-definition screen with tablet-style functionality, Volvo’s new Sensus interface sets a benchmark for intuitive operation of the new XC90’s infotainment/climate control functions. 
 
NEXT-GEN FRONT BUCKET SEATS 
Redesigned to provide even greater comfort and support, the XC90’s power-activated front bucket seats also incorporate shock-attenuating structural elements that work with its new pre-tensioning seatbelts to help minimize the potential for bodily injury in case of a front impact or run-off-road scenario.","Roomy and elegantly upscale, the XC90’s cabin details include everything from supple leather upholstery and aluminum/wood accents to its new Sensus touch interface, a 12.3-inch digital instrument display and diamond-cut surfaces on the various rotary controls. Some, like open-grain Linear Walnut inlays (Inscription), Nubuck/Nappa leather sport seats (R-Design) and an Orrefers crystal shift lever knob (T8), are model-specific. The 40/20/40 2nd-row bench seat is matched with a more-accommodating 50/50 third tier that offers best-in-class legroom. Each seat can be individually folded flat to increase cargo space from 15.8 cubic feet to a segment-leading 85.7 cubic feet – all easily accessed through a large rear hatch with hands-free activation.","The XC90’s bolder and more sophisticated SUV body lines are complemented by a new face that features a sleeker graphic character with a revised grille and redrawn logo. More expressive front/rear lighting adds visual punch while Inscription and R-Design models feature full LED headlights with corner-following Active Bending and T-shaped “Thor’s Hammer” LED running lights. Wheel/tire fitments rise from 19-inch on Momentum models to 20-inch on Inscriptions and 21-inch on the R-Design – which also gets a selection of unique trim elements and offers a bespoke Matte Metallic Blue finish.","All XC90s are comprehensively equipped, complementing a lengthy roster of expected features with premium touches like the groundbreaking Sensus touch-control interface and GPS navigation, a 10-speaker/330-watt audio package, 4-zone climate control with Clean Zone Air Quality System, a panoramic glass sunroof, and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Its bounty of active/passive protective touches include Volvo’s City Safety System with Pedestrian & Cyclist Detection and Avoidance, Lane Departure Warning, and new Run-Off-Road protection plus automatic braking should the driver inadvertently turn in front of an oncoming vehicle. Surprisingly, the new XC90 offers just one built-in USB port and has no power assist for its tilt/telescoping steering column.","Optional Equipment 
Descriptively named Climate, Convenience and Vision Packages add even more appeal to the new XC90. These include extras like Surround View Cameras, power-retracting side-view mirrors, and heating controls for the windshield, the headlight washers and the rear seats. Blind Spot/Cross Traffic warnings, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist and Park Assist Pilot are also available as part of option packages. Single options on all models include Four-Corner Air Suspension, a 1,400-watt Bowers & Wilkins premium sound system, Head-Up Display, plus an Integrated 2nd-row child booster seat along with Contour Seats in Nappa leather (Momentum only), and carbon fiber accents and 22-inch wheels (R-Design only).","Under the Hood 
 
The 2016 Volvo XC90 lineup is fitted with the automaker’s new supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter/4-cylinder Drive-E gasoline engine that makes a stout 316 horsepower and develops 295 lb-ft of torque when burning premium unleaded gasoline. The T8 Twin Engine replaces the T6’s conventional Haldex AWD setup with a rear-mounted 80-horsepower electric motor that sends all of its motive force to the aft wheels. Collectively, the combo yields 400 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque – sufficient to trim the T8’s 0-60-mph sprint time from 6.1 to just 5.9 seconds. Both XC90 SUV variants can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Their Drive-E engines are backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission that helps them earn what are projected to be best-in-class EPA ratings.

Arriving in showrooms this summer, the 2016 Volvo XC90 T6 Momentum and Inscription start just under $50,000 and $55,500, respectively. The sporty R-Design that arrives in October will open slightly below $54,000, and fully loading any version can bump those numbers by $4,000-$6,000. On sale later in the fall, T8 Twin Engine models are expected to command upwards of $60,000 and offer similar upgrade possibilities. Given its lengthy roster of standard features, the new XC90 will hold a solid price advantage against all of its comparably equipped German rivals and be competitive with the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 as well as domestic alternatives like the Cadillac SRX and the Buick Enclave. KBB.com has not yet established a Fair Purchase for this new Volvo SUV. Historically, the XC90’s resale value has not been as strong as most of its competitors. However, we suspect this comprehensive makeover will enhance its long-term competitive position.

In addition to its well-regarded driving dynamics, handsome design and surprising efficiency, the 3 Series boasts the intangible but nevertheless enviable image of success for whoever is driving it. On the practical side, the wagon and Gran Turismo variants grant crossover-SUV-like cargo room and the nimble manners of a sedan.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The BMW 3 Series is no longer the de facto choice for up-and-comers. The latest Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the next-gen Audi A4 pack more technology and amenities. The 3 Series' price tag has the tendency to soar, and driving purists bemoan this generations' softening dynamics compared to past models.","Think of an entry-level luxury sedan and the BMW 3 Series will probably come to mind. With over 40 years of history, this compact sports sedan has cemented itself in the psyche of aspirational buyers. In that time it has grown in power, stature and efficiency, and now boasts a vast lineup. From an all-wheel-drive sedan to a sports wagon, Gran Turismo hatchback, plug-in hybrid and the tarmac-eating M3, there's a 3 Series for every buyer. The 2016 3 Series remains a sporty, versatile and efficient luxury car with instant badge appeal, but sophisticated rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and Audi A4 are right on the BMW's tail or – depending on your preferences – ahead of its twin-kidney grille.","All 2016 BMW 3 Series put a focus on driving pleasure, a trait that puts them at or near the top of the segment in terms of ride and handling....","Favorite Features 
 
WAGON, HATCH VARIANTS 
Most buyers associate the BMW 3 Series with a sedan, coupe or convertible (the latter pair now the 4 Series), but BMW's compact car is also available as a Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo, a taller riding hatchback with a cool name. Both offer extra room but retain lively driving manners. 
 
TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER 
BMW's force-fed 2.0-liter is one of the best 4-cylinders available. It's powerful, with 240 horsepower on tap for 0-60-mph blasts under six seconds, and efficient with a fuel-economy rating that reaches 35 mpg on the highway. It's the best of both worlds.","","The 2016 BMW 3 Series lineup expands again with the 330e, the first plug-in hybrid 3 Series. It effectively replaces the ActiveHybrid. Also new is the 340i, with a fresh 6-cylinder engine. The rest of the lineup receives redesigned electric power steering and chassis enhancements that include new front struts.; The 2016 BMW 3 Series' link to its past is easily seen when you line up the generations side-by-side. Even casual observers know they're looking at a BMW, and today's slightly longer and taller 3 Series differentiates itself by adding more defined character lines and creases, along with a visual connection between the headlights and the signature twin-kidney grille. The more rotund Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the aggressively styled M3 hints at the potent powertrain below its skin. All in all, the latest 3 Series retains a handsome skin that mercifully shies away from the trend of gaping grilles.","At its most basic, 320i models come with BMW's faux leather upholstery (SensaTec), manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, USB port, Bluetooth music streaming and HD Radio. Safety features standard on every 2016 BMW 3 Series include eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision. New BMWs also include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost scheduled maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
Options for the 2016 3 Series are both extensive and pricey. However, some features are worth their weight in gold, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation with programmable waypoints, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the available M Sport Package help bridge the performance gap between the standard 3 Series and the fire-breathing M3. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on many models in lieu of rear-wheel drive (RWD), and is standard in the wagon and Gran Turismo.","Pricing Notes 
 
The least expensive 3 Series is the 320i, with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $34,000. The more powerful 328i begins just over $39,000. From there prices only rise, with the 330e hybrid starting at about $44,700 and the 6-cylinder 340i variants beginning just under $47,000. The BMW M3 performance model begins over $64,000. Wagon and the Gran Turismo hatchbacks start in the low- to mid-$40,000 range. At these levels the majority of 3 Series are in line with small luxury-sedan rivals like the Lexus IS, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q50 and the all-new Jaguar XE. For comparison values, check out the Acura TLX, while the Volvo S60 comes with impressive safety features for less money. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are paying for their 3 Series. The 3 Series has typically enjoyed good but not class-leading resale value.

If the Cadillac name still conjures up images of vinyl roofs and velour seats, the 2017 ATS and ATS-V probably won’t excite you the same way a BMW, Audi or Lexus will. For less money, you can get into a larger Chrysler 300 with nearly the same features and performance.","The 2017 Cadillac ATS luxury-performance series has not only proven itself worthy of world-class status, it actually has some German rivals running to play catch-up. In its more subtle clothing, the compact ATS performance sedan and coupe offer sophisticated luxury and outstanding performance credentials easily the equal of cars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. The gloves come off with the 464-horsepower 2017 Cadillac ATS-V, a track-inspired terror that chases down BMW M and Mercedes-Benz AMG cars without breaking a sweat. Of course, there is a price for perfection, and the 2017 ATS and ATS-V tend to cost more than their nearest competitors from Lincoln and Chrysler, but oh to be the standard of the world once again sure feels great.","There is no “soft” suspension with the 2017 Cadillac ATS Sedan and Coupe, just varying degrees of firmness.

FIRST-CLASS HANDLING DYNAMICS
 Designed to be a sports car from the ground up, Cadillac’s ATS for 2017 easily matches the best from Europe, and betters most from Japan. In the case of the ATS-V, the V truly is for “Vendetta,” obliterating similar-class cars from the BMW M3 to the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG.
 
 MANUAL TRANSMISSION
 Despite recent advancement in manually shifting automatics, purists will say the measure of great drivers is their ability to flog a manual transmission. Not only is the 2017 Cadillac ATS’s manual a joy, the V version features no-lift shifting, allowing the accelerator to remain planted when the clutch is depressed.","","For 2017, the; Angular bodywork set off with Cadillac's signature LED-infused vertical lighting elements gives the ATS an edge. The 2017 Cadillac ATS Coupe has the same 109.3-inch wheelbase as the sedan, but overall is slightly wider, lower and longer. The 2017 ATS-V is noticeably more muscular. An aerodynamic front splitter, side body panels and rear spoiler help keep the car planted at high velocities. Rounding out every ATS-V are quad tailpipes and 18-inch forged aluminum wheels wrapped in specialized Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. To achieve a 50/50 weight balance, the ATS-V's hood is made from pricey but lightweight carbon fiber.","Standard equipment on the 2017 Cadillac ATS Sedan and Coupe expands as you move from the base models up through the Luxury, Premium Luxury and Premium Performance grades. Spend the least and you'll still get dual-zone climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and 7-speaker Bose premium audio with USB/SD/auxiliary ports. Base ATS Coupes include rearview camera, Brembo performance front brakes and 18-inch wheels. ATS-V models have magnetic ride-control suspension, Brembo brakes and a 5-mode traction-management system with launch control for the best possible off-the-line acceleration. All models include a trial of GM's OnStar communications system with emergency assistance.","Optional Equipment 
The ATS Luxury trim brings leather interior, power front seats and rearview camera, while Premium Luxury trims come with the CUE infotainment system, 10-speaker Bose sound and Driver Awareness Package that includes lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert. Other options include blind-spot monitoring, automatic front and rear emergency braking, wireless phone-charging and magnetic ride suspension. The ATS-V can be had with an 8-speed automatic transmission with magnesium paddle shifters. A Performance Data Recorder similar to what's used on the latest Corvette records video, audio and driving data onto an SD card for later viewing on the CUE display screen or a computer.","Pricing Notes 
 
With a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $35,600, the 2017 ATS Sedan is the least expensive Cadillac. The ATS Coupe starts just under $38,600. Like its rivals, the ATS's price range is broad. Loaded versions can pass $50,000. The brawny Cadillac ATS-V is even higher, with an MSRP of around $61,760 for the sedan and just under $63,900 for the coupe. With options, the 2017 ATS-V can pass the mid-$70,000 mark. A base ATS Sedan is in line with the BMW 3 Series and Volvo S60, and higher than the Acura TLX. It is below most other rivals. The ATS-V sedan starts a few hundred shy of the BMW M3. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The ATS's resale value is expected to be in line with the 3 Series and A4 but trail that of the Lexus IS.

The BMW 4 Series is in reality a 3 Series coupe, and if you're looking for the driving dynamics of that sedan but in a sleeker package, you've found your ride. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe? It's as practical as it is beautiful thanks to its spacious hatch.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
It's no longer the case that BMW owns the sporty-luxury coupe market. There are the new 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe, the Cadillac ATS Coupe, the Audi A5 and S5, and the 2017 Infiniti Q60. All give the 4 Series a run for its money in style and power.","The entire 2017 BMW 4 Series family got a special birthday present for its third year: new engines. The new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo and 3.0-liter 6-cylinder turbo boast more power and torque, and come with new nomenclature; BMW 4 Series coupes, convertibles and Gran Coupe 4-door models with the 4-cylinder are now known as 430i, while the 6-cylinder models are 440i. The engine upgrades are the biggest change in a year that's otherwise defined by incremental upgrades, but that's fine, as the BMW 4 Series is already a compelling choice against the likes of the Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Lexus RC. Whether you want rear- or all-wheel drive, or the fire-breathing M4, the 4 Series blends performance and refinement with its $40,000-plus starting price.","The 2017 4 Series, like its predecessors, takes the agility, acceleration and balance of the 3 Series and augments it all with a wider stance and lower center of gravity....","Favorite Features 
 
2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE
 We said that the old base-level engine in the 4 Series was good enough that there was little reason to shell out for the 6-cylinder variant. That holds true with the new engine as well; it's more powerful, has more torque, and doesn't sacrifice fuel economy to get it.
 
 FOLDING HARDTOP
 The BMW 4 Series convertible doesn't force you to choose between a classic coupe or open-top convertible, thanks to its power-operated retractable hardtop. Top up, it's a sharp coupe with the classic BMW ""Hofmeister kink"" at the rear window; top down you have open-air enjoyment for yourself and three passengers.","","Two new engines, with horsepower upgrades, headline the changes for the 2017 BMW 4 Series lineup. More minor changes include variations on seat stitching, and an upgrade to iDrive 5.0.; The 2017 BMW 4 Series headlights flow into the ""twin-kidney"" grille, emphasizing the width of the car, while the low roof gives it a sleeker profile than the 3 Series sedan. The 4 Series Gran Coupe looks similar to the svelte 6 Series Gran Coupe, but its power tailgate opens to a large cargo area. The 4 Series convertible resembles an older BMW coupe in profile -- think 3 Series from the mid-1990s -- and its hard top offers better insulation and security than fabric. M4 performance models up the aggression with larger front air intakes, power-dome hood and quad exhaust outlets.","The base-model 2017 BMW 430i Coupe, Gran Coupe and Convertible may look different, but all have about the same levels of standard equipment. There are power front seats, adaptive xenon headlights, automatic climate control, and on the Coupe and Gran Coupe, a moonroof; the Gran Coupe also gets a power tailgate. Standard infotainment is a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB audio input, Bluetooth streaming and 6.5-inch display (unfortunately, a rearview camera still costs extra). If you want more power, opt for the 440i and its stronger 6-cylinder engine; if that's not enough, the 2017 M4 features performance-oriented brakes and differential.","Optional Equipment 
There's little that's not available on the 2017 4 Series. You can upgrade to a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon sound system, a hands-free trunk that opens when you wave your foot under the bumper, and real leather upholstery to replace the synthetic SensaTec stuff. Most options are bundled into packages, like the Technology Package that includes navigation and dedicated apps. A Driver Assistance package adds the blind-spot monitoring and Active Driving Assistant with lane-departure warning, collision-mitigation automatic braking and pedestrian detection. M4 models can bolster their performance potential with carbon-ceramic brakes and driver-selectable Adaptive M Suspension.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base-model 2017 BMW 430i Coupe or Gran Coupe is a little less than $43,000, including the $995 destination charge. A 430i convertible is right under the $51,000 mark. Prices climb quickly: 6-cylinder 440i models are about $7,000 more across the board, and all-wheel drive will add about $2,000 to whatever model you choose. And that's before options, which can easily shoot the price up to nearly $70,000. The M4 models start at more than $67,000 for the coupe and more than $75,500 for the convertible, and top out well over $80,000. That's a lot, but on par with competitors like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS, Audi A5 and S5, and Lexus RC. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what people in your area paid for their 4 Series, and note resale value will be average, lagging the Lexus RC.

WAGON, HATCH VARIANTS
 Most buyers associate the BMW 3 Series with a sedan, but BMW's most popular model is also available as a Sports Wagon and a hatchback called Gran Turismo. Both offer extra room and practicality but retain the lively driving manners the 3 Series is famous for.
 
 TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER
 BMW's new turbocharged 2.0-liter is one of the best 4-cylinder engines on the planet. It's smooth and powerful, with 248 horsepower on tap for 0-60-mph blasts under six seconds, and efficient with a fuel-economy rating that reaches 34 mpg on the highway. It's the best of both worlds.","","A new 4-cylinder engine brings new nomenclature; the 330i replaces the 328i. An all-new 6-cylinder engine does the same higher in the lineup with the 335i being replaced by the 340i. There are also trim and color tweaks, including the M Sport Package becoming standard on 340i models.; This is simply one of the most attractive cars on the road. With short overhangs and a low, wide stance, the 2017 BMW 3 Series just looks athletic. It looks like it’s fun to drive. It’s a completely modern design, but there are enough links to previous generations, including the signature twin-kidney grille, that even casual observers know they're looking at a BMW. The more rotund Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the Sports Wagon is universally admired, and the bulging, scooped and flared skin of the macho M3 hints at the potency below its domed hood.","At its most basic, 320i models come with BMW's faux-leather upholstery (SensaTec), manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, USB port, Bluetooth music streaming and HD Radio. Safety features standard on every 2017 BMW 3 Series include eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision. New BMWs also include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost scheduled maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
Options on the 2017 3 Series are extensive and pricey. However, many are worth the investment, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the M Sport Package (now standard on the 340i) help bridge the performance gap between lesser models and the fire-breathing M3. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on many models in lieu of rear-wheel drive (RWD), although not on the M3, and is standard on the wagon and Gran Turismo.","Pricing Notes 
 
The least expensive 3 Series is the 320i sedan with a manual transmission, its Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $35,000, with 6-cylinder 340i variants beginning just under $49,000. The high-performance BMW M3 begins over $65,000. Wagon and Gran Turismo hatchbacks start in the mid-$40,000 range and the plug-in hybrid 330e starts around $45,500. All-wheel drive is available on most models and adds about $2,000. At these levels most 3 Series models are in line with small-luxury-sedan rivals like the Lexus IS, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q50 and the all-new Jaguar XE. For comparison values, check out the Acura TLX, while the Volvo S60 comes with impressive safety features for less money.

The luxurious 2017 S60 Inscription delivers luxury on par with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and its stretched wheelbase permits an additional three inches of rear-seat legroom.

Being a Volvo, the 2017 S60 starts with safety, including three active systems: City Safety helps avoid low-speed collisions in slow, stop-and-go traffic; Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake senses an impending collision and can brake to reduce the severity of a crash; and Pedestrian Detection with Full Auto Brake that also auto-brakes (see Favorite Features). Inscription models include upscale interior features as well as more room, including a rearview camera, walnut wood inlays, additional sound deadening, a power rear-window sunshade, and silk-metal accents.","Optional Equipment 
Options for Volvo’s 2017 S60 sedan lineup include 19-inch wheels for the Sport Package, which also adds paddle shifters and sporty chassis enhancements. You can add Volvo's Park Assist Pilot to the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) package. A Convenience package adds keyless entry and start, a rearview camera and power-folding exterior mirrors. Not surprisingly, the Swedish automaker also offers a Climate package that adds heated front seats, windshield, steering wheel and windshield-wiper nozzles. The base model offers a harman/kardon navigation audio system while stand-alone options include different-sized wheels and a variety of accessories.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volvo S60 T5 Dynamic starts off reasonably enough with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $35,000. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) Inscription T5 starts at just under $40,000, while the AWD Cross Country starts just over $45,000. It is roughly $1,500 to add all-wheel drive to models not so equipped, but even then the Volvo S60 generally undercuts competitors like the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan, although some Lexus and Infiniti models are more price-competitive. Before buying, be sure to check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to see what others in your area are paying. Based on 5-Year Cost-to-Own, the Volvo S60 is a stellar buy. The low initial purchase price plus low maintenance and repair costs make the Volvo S60 a good choice, and its safety story is, of course, unsurpassed.

 Audi’s commitment to safety is in full view with the available adaptive cruise control. Not only can the system regulate speed to keep a safe distance between the A3 and the traffic ahead, it can actually bring the vehicle to a full stop all on its own.","Audi has set a high bar with its interiors, with high-style design and immaculate fit and finish. Yet while the 2017 A3 scores well on materials and assembly, it's a little on the bland side compared with other Audi vehicles. That said, it's cleanly designed and suitably sporty, with simple audio and climate controls. We wish the MMI infotainment interface wasn't placed quite so low on the console though, as it makes it hard to see which button does what until you've learned it by touch. Not surprisingly, rear-seat accommodations are pretty tight, especially for three passengers.","If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2017 A3’s new look.

Multiple engine configurations confront prospective Audi A3 owners. Front-wheel-drive models get a new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, an upgrade from last year's smaller engine, now boasting 186 horsepower which gets to the front wheels through a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. If you want quattro all-wheel drive, you'll get an engine upgrade as well: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 220 horsepower, as well as a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (which is also used in the econo-oriented A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid). Audi S3 models get a version of the 2.0-liter engine that sends its 292 horsepower to all four wheels. Note that both the A3 and S3 require premium fuel.

Audi A4 fans are going to love it, that's for certain. But if you're looking for a luxury sedan that's great to drive, offers class-leading technology, looks great and is even a bargain in its market segment, you'll be hard-pressed to do better than the 2017 Audi A4.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The high-tech gauges may not be for everyone, and they're standard on top-line Prestige models. Additionally, while bigger than the Cadillac ATS, the Audi A4's rear seat is on the small side compared to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.","As the newest version of its most popular sedan, there's a lot riding on the new 2017 Audi A4. Good thing Audi nailed it. The new Audi A4 is packed full of cutting-edge and class-exclusive technology, like a customizable instrument display that shows not just gauges, but Google maps and directions. The new adaptive cruise control is integrated with GPS so it automatically slows the car as you approach a turn. But even without the electronic wizardry, the new Audi A4 would be a worthy competitor against the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and other competitors. The powerful engine, available all-wheel drive and sharp driving dynamics make this car fun no matter what.","Even if you strip away all the high-tech digital gauges, amazing adaptive cruise control and adjustable shocks that you get on top-end 2017 A4 models, the new A4 is still...","Favorite Features 
 
VIRTUAL COCKPIT
 Nobody has taken LCD gauges as far as Audi. The Google maps -- complete with satellite view -- take over the entire display once you minimize the gauges. And that's just the tip of the iceberg; suffice it to say it makes the A4 feel like a spaceship.
 
 ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
 The 2017 Audi A4’s adaptive cruise control is terrific. Yes, it slows itself in traffic to a complete stop, but it goes even further. Using GPS and navigation, it knows when a turn is coming up, and automatically slows to a safe speed. It also slows for off-ramps when using route guidance.","While the big news is the virtual cockpit, there's more to the 2017 A4 interior than the tech. MMI gets a big improvement, using a touch pad to make entering addresses a breeze. The dash is simpler as well, with the new MMI screen moved to the top as we've seen in other recent Audi models. The basics are spot-on, too, with comfortable seats, easy-to-use main controls and first-rate materials. The smallish rear seat, lack of a soft spot for the driver's right knee to rest, and a sometimes busy virtual cockpit display are the only real downsides.","At first glance there's not much new, but upon closer inspection, nothing was left unchanged. The car is a little wider and longer, but with more angular lines around the grille, headlights, and details. Take the character line that runs along the side of the car, for example. On the old one it petered out weakly as it approached the taillight. Now it boldly cuts through to the trunk on one end, while in front, the hood itself makes up the upper portion of the line. The proportions are spot-on, and the car just looks right from any angle.","Of course the 2017 Audi A4 comes nicely equipped. Standard issue on even the base model Premium includes 3-zone automatic climate control, leather seating and a power sunroof. The MMI infotainment display is mounted high on the dash, with the rotary controller in front of the shifter. All Audi A4 models also come with keyless ignition, HID headlights with cool LED accents, a rearview camera, and LED taillights above dual exhausts. Other standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, paddle shifters for the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, automatic start/stop to help conserve fuel at stoplights, and Audi's Drive Select adjustable drive modes.","Optional Equipment 
We've talked the virtual cockpit to death, but it's standard on the Prestige Plus and Premium models, and available on the base model. Also available is a 7-inch infotainment screen, or an 8.2-inch version with navigation and the whole enchilada. A sport suspension option lowers ride height about an inch and gives the A4 more bite in corners, and an available adaptive-damping suspension lowers the car about half an inch and adds different shock-absorber stiffness for Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. On Prestige Plus and Premium models you get 18-inch wheels and available summer tires.","Under the Hood 
 
There's only one engine available for the 2017 Audi A4, and it's a gem. With 2.0 liters of displacement, it puts out 252 turbocharged horsepower, routing it through a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission that can be operated in normal ""D,"" in sportier ""S,"" or manually through the standard steering-wheel-mounted paddles. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and will get you to 60 mph in about 6.1 seconds. However, most Audi A4 models will be purchased with the company's excellent quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system, which not only provides superior handling and wet-weather grip, but also accelerates the A4 from a standstill to 60 mph in about 5.7 seconds.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4
 252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/33 mpg (FWD), 24/31 mpg (AWD)","Pricing Notes 
 
The base model 2017 Audi A4 Prestige gets a price bump from last year, but also gets more standard equipment. Still, with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $38,300, it's on the lower end of the price spectrum for its class, especially considering standard leather upholstery. That's for front-wheel drive; if you want quattro, add about $2,100, which applies across the A4 lineup. On the other end of the spectrum, a quattro-equipped A4 Prestige will run you about $49,000, and if you start choosing options on your build-to-own page, you'll escalate that up to the mid-$50,000 range.

TURBOCHARGED ENGINE 
Audi has been putting turbocharged engines in its luxury sedans for decades and it has practically perfected the formula. The 2.0-liter A4 engine is smooth, powerful and efficient, although it does fall short of the fuel-economy figures posted by the turbo-4 in the BMW 320i. 
 
DETAIL EXECUTION 
There’s a certain artistry in the way Audi assembles the A4’s interior, from the delicate wood inlays to the harmonious shapes to the soft leather seats. There is no mistaking an Audi interior for any other.","","Audi’s A4 and S4 sedans for 2016 receive a few upgrades including a standard 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel on the entry-level Premium trim, a Bang & Olufsen sound system added to the Technology package on Premium Plus trims and new 19-inch wheels for the S line competition plus package.; The 2016 Audi A4’s signature look is certainly familiar, and it remains exceptionally handsome and refined. There is no mistaking it’s an Audi, with the clean and elegantly detailed exterior that makes it one of the best-looking sedans on the road. There are numerous option packages that include different wheel treatments to individualize the appearance, and the high-end and super-performance S4 has a more aggressive look that emphasizes its purposeful mission.","The 2016 Audi A4 line is available in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. Premium leads off with 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power front seats, leather upholstery, Sirius satellite radio and the Convenience Package, which includes Bluetooth, HomeLink, Audi Music Interface connectivity, and the driver-information system. Premium Plus models tout unique 18-inch, 10-spoke wheels for a sportier appearance. Keyless entry and start is part of the Premium Plus, and Audi drive select is standard on the S4. The Prestige trim also includes navigation and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.","Optional Equipment 
The A4 Prestige package offers further upgrades to the S line package, which includes sport suspension, 19-inch wheels, different front and rear fascias, side skirts, unique doorsills and badging. A4 Prestige models also offer a Driver Assist package, consisting of adaptive cruise control (automatically maintains a distance from a vehicle in front) and adjustment of control dynamics, including steering effort, throttle response and transmission-shift characteristics. The A4 and S4 models also offer a Sport Plus package with high-gloss exterior trim and 19-inch Titanium Rotor design wheels.","Pricing Notes 
 
Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Audi A4 sedan starts just under $37,000 for a Premium trim with the CVT and front-wheel drive. That same driveline in Prestige trim is around $44,000. Move to the 6-speed manual with quattro AWD, and prices range from around $38,000 for the Premium to nearly $45,000 for the Prestige. Load on the two packages available for Prestige (S line and Driver Assist), and your A4 will be well over $50,000. The hard-charging S4 starts around $50,000 and can easily go far beyond $60,000.

CLEAN, CLASSY DESIGN
 Jaguars have long stood out with exterior styling that is sleek yet classic, contemporary yet classy. The newest sedan from the British luxury automaker carries that forward, as the 2017 XE makes an elegant and powerful statement wherever it goes.
 
 EFFICIENT AND EXHILARATING ENGINES
 We laud not only Jag's stout and efficient diesel engine, but the fact that the automaker is sticking with it. For drivers seeking speed over efficiency, the XE is also available with the exhilarating supercharged V6 used in the F-Type sports car.","","The 2017 Jaguar XE is all-new. Along with the F-Pace; It shouldn't be a surprise the compact XE sedan looks like a smaller iteration of the XF","Step into the least expensive Jaguar XE compact sports sedan, and you'll get Luxtec faux leather in black, tan or gray, dual-zone climate control, rear-passenger vents, 17-inch alloy wheels and moonroof. The standard infotainment system consists of Jaguar's InControl 8-inch touch-screen display and 6-speaker, 80-watt audio system with HD Radio, USB inputs and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Surprisingly, a rearview camera still costs extra. We recommend the XE Premium, which adds a folding rear seat, auto-dimming and folding side mirrors, an upscale 11-speaker Meridian audio system and HomeLink garage-door opener. All new XE sedans come with a 5-year/60,000-mile warranty and complimentary maintenance/roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Jag XE offers a wide array of extras, many of which are bundled into higher trims. Prestige models, for instance, include navigation, leather interior with heated front seats and heated steering wheel, keyless entry and power-adjustable steering column. Top-line Jaguar XE R-Sport trims ladle on a slew of otherwise optional safety features that include blind-spot monitoring, front and rear parking aids, autonomous emergency braking and lane-departure warning. Additional options vary by trim and include cooled front seats, power-operated trunk, power rear sunshade, CD/DVD player, in-car Wi-Fi 3G hotspot, and parallel/perpendicular park assist.","Pricing Notes 
 
The all-new Jaguar XE sedan arrives with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $36,000, which is just on top of the starting point of a base BMW 3 Series and just below a Mercedes C-Class, Lexus IS and Audi A4. Opting for the diesel Jaguar XE is an additional $1,500. Stepping up to the supercharged V6 Jaguar XE puts you in the low-$40,000 territory. Fully loaded, an XE can crest $60,000. These figures may raise eyebrows for what's called an ""entry-level"" luxury sedan, but they're not that unusual. Those looking for pricing with lesser sting can find it in the Infiniti Q50, Acura TLX and Cadillac ATS.

It’s difficult to think of a luxury-performance coupe that combines all the qualities of the Infiniti Q60 for less than $45,000. So, if you’re in the market for an ultra-stylish luxury coupe with genuine sporting credentials, the 2017 Q60 might be the ticket.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Though upscale, the Q60’s interior trails that of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A5 when it comes to refinement, materials quality and infotainment. To that end, the Q60 lacks premium feature content like an electronic parking brake, ventilated front seats, a power-operated trunk or head-up display.","Straddling the line between dedicated sports cars and luxury coupes, the completely revamped 2017 Infiniti Q60 is much more than just a pretty face. Beyond its drop-dead gorgeous exterior, the Q60 charms with a comfortably sporty interior, optional twin-turbo V6, and industry-first steer-by-wire system, all of which help it bring the fight directly to longtime segment standouts like the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC, Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe.","With no physical connection between the wheel in your hand and the wheels on the road, arguably the biggest story here is the Q60’s optional steer-by-wire system.

BOSE PERFORMANCE SERIES AUDIO
 This 13-speaker sound system delivers exceptional high-frequency output and tonal accuracy. Not only that, but the metal speaker grilles are just as functional as they are beautiful.
 
 REVERSE AUTOMATIC BRAKING
 No one enjoys backing out of a congested parking lot. Thankfully, the Q60’s available reverse automatic braking system can apply the brakes before the possible collision with an object you may have never seen in the first place.","The Q60 boasts a generally well-crafted cabin with high-quality materials and unique trim elements like Infiniti’s exclusive Silver Optic Fiber scheme. Though rear headroom is not suitable for adults, legroom out back is shockingly acceptable, and the trunk can swallow a pair of small carry-ons. In terms of connectivity, the InTouch dual-screen infotainment platform is a bit of a mixed bag. Some functions respond without delay and others require two to three seconds for a reaction to occur. The upper navigation screen is much more responsive to both touch and remote inputs, though its mapping interface and graphics are a bit outdated.","Only a handful of production models can wear a concept-car exterior and get away with it, and the Q60 is one of them. Bucking the “good from afar, but far from good” designs of late, a closer look reveals intricate touches and careful attention to detail ranging from drilled exhaust tips, to a 3D grille badge, to a unique aero bulge that begins in the grille and extends to the hood.","Impressively well-equipped in base form, key standards consists of 19-inch wheels, keyless access with push-button start, a dizzying array of drive settings, LED headlights and taillights, an 8-way-power driver’s seat with manual lumbar support, a rearview camera, and a 6-speaker sound system tied to a dual-screen infotainment center. Sadly, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available on any trim level.","Optional Equipment 
Forget about sending your kids to college, and you can drive away with goodies like heated seats, a heated steering wheel, semi-aniline leather, navigation and a low-resolution 360-degree camera system. If active safety is on your mind, just know that lane-keeping assist, blind-spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, and predictive forward collision that can react to situations occurring in front of the vehicle ahead are available only on V6 models. Stepping up to the line-topping Red Sport lands you 400 horsepower, larger brakes, electronically controlled suspension and paddle shifters.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2017 Infiniti Q60 2.0t and Premium 2.0t are powered by a, you guessed it, 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Like every Q60, a 7-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive (RWD) are standard, but all-wheel drive (AWD) is available as a $2,000 option. Premium and Sport 3.0t models make use of a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 that generates 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, while Red Sport 400s employ an up-tuned version that cranks out an additional 100 horsepower and 55 lb-ft of torque with virtually no drop in fuel economy.

Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP) begin just shy of $40,000 and top out right around $60,000 for a fully loaded Red Sport 400. In base form, the Q60 undercuts rivals like the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe by more than $2,000 and comes with a longer list of standard equipment to boot. Besides the aforementioned 4 Series and C-Class, the Q60’s competitive set includes the well-rounded Audi A5 (starting at $42,000) and TT (starting at $44,000), the very nearly over-styled Lexus RC (starting at $41,000), and the brilliant but decidedly more expensive Porsche 718 Cayman (starting at $55,000). Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new Q60. Things get a bit dicey on the resale front, as the 2017 Infiniti Q60 is expected to retain some of the lowest 5-year residual values in the category.

There are still some 4-cylinder turbo coupes that are quicker than the V6-powered RC 350. They also get better fuel economy. If the RC’s styling comes off as too aggressive, a BMW 4 Series, an Infiniti Q60 or Audi A5 might be a better choice.","For the longest time, Lexus coupes were more about luxury and precision craftsmanship than posing a serious challenge to Europe’s best performance-oriented cars. With the advent of the 2017 Lexus RC luxury-sports coupe, all that has changed. Displaying styling more aggressive than a BMW 4 Series or an Audi A5, the RC appeals to a younger set without completely alienating traditional Lexus buyers. We’d say the RC is great direct competitor to the Cadillac ATS, which also has a bold, expressive face, numerous engine options and a reputation for being a beast on and off the track. Not to leave anyone unchallenged, the Lexus RC F offers a powerful V8 engine but, unlike the RC coupe, is driven solely by its rear wheels.","With four possible engine options, the 2017 Lexus RC coupe offers a wide range of performance possibilities limited only by the amount of money in your checkbook.

The 10-speaker audio system includes HD Radio, dual USB inputs and Bluetooth streaming with Eyes Free iPhone integration. F Sport models get standard variable suspension and Sport+ driving mode, heated and ventilated front seats, a suspension tuned for higher performance, and a power-adjust steering wheel. RC F models include bigger brakes, front sport seats and forged BBS aluminum wheels.","Optional Equipment 
The options list starts with a navigation system that uses a touch-pad controller and includes an upgraded Enform suite with services such as Yelp, Pandora and stock prices. There are also heated/ventilated front seats, a leather interior, heated steering wheel and a moonroof. The Mark Levinson premium audio system makes even your iPod sound amazing, and should top the list for music lovers.

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting right around $40,000 for a base, rear-drive C300 sedan.

The 2017 Cadillac ATS Coupe has the same 109.3-inch wheelbase as the sedan, but overall is slightly wider, lower and longer. The 2017 ATS-V is noticeably more muscular. An aerodynamic front splitter, side body panels and rear spoiler help keep the car planted at high velocities. Rounding out every ATS-V are quad tailpipes and 18-inch forged aluminum wheels wrapped in specialized Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. To achieve a 50/50 weight balance, the ATS-V's hood is made from pricey but lightweight carbon fiber.","Standard equipment on the 2017 Cadillac ATS Sedan and Coupe expands as you move from the base models up through the Luxury, Premium Luxury and Premium Performance grades. Spend the least and you'll still get dual-zone climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and 7-speaker Bose premium audio with USB/SD/auxiliary ports. Base ATS Coupes include rearview camera, Brembo performance front brakes and 18-inch wheels. ATS-V models have magnetic ride-control suspension, Brembo brakes and a 5-mode traction-management system with launch control for the best possible off-the-line acceleration. All models include a trial of GM's OnStar communications system with emergency assistance.","Optional Equipment 
The ATS Luxury trim brings leather interior, power front seats and rearview camera, while Premium Luxury trims come with the CUE infotainment system, 10-speaker Bose sound and Driver Awareness Package that includes lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert. Other options include blind-spot monitoring, automatic front and rear emergency braking, wireless phone-charging and magnetic ride suspension. The ATS-V can be had with an 8-speed automatic transmission with magnesium paddle shifters. A Performance Data Recorder similar to what's used on the latest Corvette records video, audio and driving data onto an SD card for later viewing on the CUE display screen or a computer.","Pricing Notes

The brand has some catching up to do on cachet.","Alfa Romeo’s return to the U.S. hinges on the success of the all-new Giulia sedan, and the Italian make’s attention to the mechanical details and the driving dynamics bodes well for this effort. The Giulia is a stylish, compact sedan that offers enthusiast-grade performance at a price that makes it competitive with German rivals like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4.

DNA DRIVE MODES
 Alfa’s changeable driving-mode system offers three settings: Dynamic, Normal and Advanced Efficiency. The beauty is that there is a discernable effect at each step where the steering effort, throttle input and even the exhaust note get progressively aggressive. The QV has a bonus Race mode to minimize stability-control intervention.
 
 Q4 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
 Optional on the Ti trim, Alfa’s Q4 all-wheel drive turns this rear-drive sports sedan into an all-season tourer with the ability to deliver up to 60 percent of available torque to the front wheels.","","The all-new Giorgio platform developed by; The 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia is a handsome car.

But the detailing itself rings truer to the car’s Italian heritage from the traditional Alfa triangle grille to the gentle sculpting of the body surfaces. This powerful-looking car gains more presence as you move up to the Ti and QV models, thanks to larger wheel-and-tire packages. The optional sport pack on the Ti brings the same carbon-fiber rear-deck spoiler used on the QV, while the latter has its own distinctive automatic deploying front chin spoiler.","The equipment list is fairly comprehensive for the Giulia, which includes Brembo disc brakes, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather interior, dual-zone climate control, push-button start mounted on the steering wheel, rearview camera with cross-traffic detection, park sensors, keyless entry, advanced brake assist, bi-xenon headlights and 6-way-power seats.

Who doesn’t love a powerful car with tenacious grip that is also a livable daily driver? The 2017 Subaru WRX’s Continuously Variable automatic Transmission (CVT) means everyone can be onboard for the fun, while all-wheel drive provides year-round driving confidence.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
You can achieve nearly the same performance in a less conspicuous turbocharged compact such as the VW GTI, Ford Focus ST or Honda Civic Si.

Buried beneath the phalanx of modern driver-assist technology, integrated app and infotainment technology and creature-comfort technology is a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine offered in two temperatures: spicy and red-hot. With standard all-wheel drive, the 2017 Subaru WRX offers more grip than a Volkswagen GTI, Honda Civic Si or Ford Focus ST, although all-wheel-drive competitors like the less powerful VW Golf R and more powerful Ford Focus RS are a good match for the WRX STI. Those looking for a less conspicuous ride might consider a pre-owned Audi S3.","Whether you chose the 6-speed manual or advanced CVT automatic, Subaru’s WRX for 2017 delivers focused performance and driving thrills few others in this price range can match. Credit goes...","Favorite Features 
 
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION
 While automatic transmissions have gotten better at shifting and conserving fuel, there is just no substitute fora good manual transmission. The precise action and positive engagement delivered by the WRX’s 6-speed manual make the intricate ballet between man and machine infinitely more enjoyable than just tapping paddles.
 
 SPORT SEATS
 Given the wide and varying size of today’s drivers, finding a set of snug sport seats that can satisfy most is no small task. In the 2017 WRX performance sedan, Subaru’s use of high-grip fabric and aggressive leg and side bolstering keeps the driver firmly in place without cramping one’s style.","","Subaru’s 2017 WRX performance sedan gains a tricot headliner and auto up/down front windows, while the base STI gains auto on/off headlights with wiper activation plus available blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert. The EyeSight collision-avoidance system is now offered but only on WRX Limited trim.; Although still mechanically and stylistically based on the 2017","The basic 2017 Subaru WRX sedan comes standard with automatic climate control, a rearview camera and a sleek audio system using Subaru's Starlink touch screen, which includes Bluetooth, Pandora, iHeart Radio and USB and auxiliary inputs. Performance items include a 268-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, 17-inch alloy wheels with performance tires, and Subaru's active torque-vectoring system that uses the brakes to control understeer. The Subaru WRX STI gets dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and suede-like Alcantara upholstery. Safety features include seven airbags, a suite of electronic stability aids and Subaru's rigid body structure.","Optional Equipment 
Subaru divides most of the options for its WRX and WRX STI into trim levels. WRX Premium models get an inverted-strut suspension similar to the higher-performance STI model, plus fog lights, an all-weather package that adds heated front seats, and bigger wheels and tires. WRX and WRX STI Limited models get a navigation system (optional on WRX Limited models), 8-way-power driver's seat, and leather upholstery. Stand-alone options include Subaru's rear-vision system, which features cross-traffic alert and blind-spot detection. Curiously, Subaru's EyeSight collision avoidance and active cruise control (includes Steering Responsive headlights and Reverse Automatic Braking) are available only on the Limited trims.","Pricing Notes 
 
Considering the performance envelope, the roughly $27,500 Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a basic 2017 Subaru WRX is pretty reasonable, and the CVT automatic adds $1,200 to that. The WRX STI starts higher, at a little more than $35,000, but even that undercuts the starting price of a new Volkswagen Golf R. A fully loaded WRX Limited will cost about $36,000, while a decked-out STI is a bit under $41,000. The Ford Focus ST and Scion FR-S start around $25,000, while the Honda Civic Si sedan and Hyundai Veloster Turbo begin in the low-$23,000 range; none of those cars offer all-wheel drive, though. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to ensure you get the best deal on your next car. Down the road, 5-year resale values for the 2017 WRX and STI should be topped only by the segment-leading Civic Si.

Chevy’s 2017 Volt appeals to two kinds of people. First, there are those looking for green street cred, but who also don't want to be scrambling for an outlet on a weekend road trip. Then there are those who simply want an affordable, good-looking, nice-driving, exceptionally fuel-efficient car.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
About the only downside to the 2017 Volt is the rear seat, which may have three seatbelts, but is still too tight for extended road trips.","For 2017 Chevrolet’s Volt improves upon the 1st-generation car in a number of ways. It has better all-electric range, with 53 miles on battery power easily attainable. It can go a total of 420 miles thanks to a more fuel-efficient engine. But beyond efficiency, it's just a better car, period. It's fun to drive, with a nicely sorted suspension, good steering and decent power from its unique drivetrain. The interior is both more conventional and more high-tech than before, thanks to the use of real buttons combined with features like Apple CarPlay. It can even seat five people, at least for short drives, and it looks great. The price is also spot-on with the Toyota Prius, after you deduct for federal and state EV credits.","The 2nd-generation Chevy Volt is better the moment you pull away from a stop.

53-MILE RANGE
 It's not unusual for electric vehicles to fall short of their claimed battery-only range. But the Volt's 53 miles is real-world proven. We managed to get 50 miles of EV range while cooking it on a famously twisty road north of San Francisco, just shy of its claimed range.
 
 APPLE CARPLAY
 Apple CarPlay brings the cleverly intuitive interface you love on your iPhone directly to the dash of your car. Just plug in your phone tap the CarPlay icon on the screen, and you have access to Siri, texts, maps, iTunes music and more. As those apps improve, so does CarPlay.","Chevrolet wisely ditched the too-high-tech capacitive buttons and Star Trek-inspired shiny white plastic for a more conventional interior. It was a smart move, and one that works beautifully, with a sensible layout that includes a great new touch-screen infotainment display. A multi-info display between the main gauges lets you use buttons on the steering wheel to monitor speed, battery use and myriad other functions. Front-seat room is fine, but the rear seat is still on the tight side for taller passengers, while the new fifth seating position is for short trips only.","Apparently, someone in Chevy design decided it would be a good idea for their flagship EV to NOT look dopey. Good call, we say, as the 2017 Volt is maybe the first alternative-fuel vehicle that people will buy simply because they fell in love with its appearance. While it retains the same general design theme -- 5-door","The base-model 2017 Chevrolet Volt LT comes very nicely equipped from the get-go. There's push-button start and remote start along with keyless entry, automatic climate control, and 4G LTE OnStar with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. That 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system is standard, as is Apple CarPlay. There's a rearview camera, plus cruise control and a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel with multiple controls for the various audio and infotainment systems. Standard safety equipment counts multiple airbags, including a knee airbag to prevent sliding under the steering wheel in a collision.","Optional Equipment 
Leather seats and a Bose audio system are both optional in the Volt LT, meaning if you want those features you don't have to make the stretch to the more expensive Volt Premier model. If you do, though, not only are those features included, but you also can order Chevrolet's Driver Confidence Package, which includes lane-keeping assist, low-speed automatic braking, and lets you order adaptive cruise control. The Premier is the only model that offers navigation as well, at a surprisingly affordable $495.","Under the Hood 
 
There's only one drivetrain for the 2017 Chevrolet Volt, consisting of two parts. There's the range-extending 4-cylinder gasoline engine, which displaces 1.5 liters and puts out 101 horsepower. But it's a generator, there to supply electricity to the electric motor when the 18.4-kWh battery runs out of juice after about 50 miles. Actual motivation for the Volt is thanks to a pair of electric motors with an output of 149 horsepower. A 50-mile range may not sound like much, but Chevrolet notes that about 90 percent of car trips fall within that range, plus the Volt can go up to 420 miles before refueling with regular unleaded. A full recharge takes about 4.5 hours on a 240-volt charger or roughly 13 hours on a standard 120-volt plug.
 
 Dual-electric motor /generator

 1.5-liter inline-4 (drives generator only)
 111 kW/149 horsepower
 294 lb-ft of torque
 EPA projected full-charge range: 53 miles (all-electric), 420 miles (combined)
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 106 MPGe (all-electric, mpg equivalent), 43 city/42 highway mpg (on gasoline engine/generator)","Pricing Notes 
 
The base 2017 Chevrolet Volt LT has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over the $34,000 mark, including the $875 destination charge. Note, that's before deducting $7,500 in federal tax credits, not to mention any state or local credits. The 2017 Volt Premier adds leather seats and more, bumping the price to about $38,500. As for competition, other plug-in hybrids like the Ford C-Max Energi aren't much less expensive, but offer significantly less range. Some pure EVs like the Nissan Leaf are also less expensive, but don't have the ability to go much past 80 miles without needing a full recharge. Historically, electric vehicles don't do well when it comes to resale value, and the Volt splits the difference between the Ford C-Max Energi and Toyota Prius Plug-In.

The 2017 Acura ILX offers up a lot of premium content in a car with a premium badge, but without a premium high price. If you're looking for a sedan and want a brand that isn't mainstream, the ILX is worth a look.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Acura name doesn't have the same cachet as Mercedes-Benz or Audi, and many shoppers these days are looking for subcompact SUVs, not sedans. Then there's the simple fact that everything available in the ILX is also available in larger mainstream vehicles, such as the Honda Accord.","Last year, Acura hit the reset button on its smallest sedan, giving it a new nose and tail, improved technology, and a new standard engine and 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. This 2017 Acura ILX carries over pretty much unchanged, with the exception of some new colors. That's fine, as we found the new ILX to be a pretty solid little car. Based on the previous-generation Honda Civic, the ILX actually hides its roots rather well, thanks to its extra power, distinct transmission, and styling that's very much in line with what we've seen in other Acura models. Like its primary competitor, the Buick Verano, the ILX offers a lot of car for the money, especially compared to the Mercedes-Benz CLA and Audi A3.","The 201-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder in the 2017 Acura ILX has found the perfect partner in Acura's 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. But what's really remarkable about the whole thing is how...","Favorite Features 
 
8-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
 This dual-clutch automatic transmission is a gem. It automates the function of a manual transmission for quicker shifting and, while similar transmissions are available from several manufacturers, the Acura version has a twist: There's also an old-school torque converter, providing a torque boost and smoother operation overall.
 
 TETHERED NAVIGATION APP
 If you have an iPhone and an extra $159, you can still get navigation in your mid-level Acura ILX without springing for the higher trim level. A $60 app incorporates your phone and a special $99 HDMI adapter cable, and you can use your phone's data plan for navigation.","The Acura ILX is much quieter since its 2016 upgrade, making it less stressful to drive, and sportier since you can now hear the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder's satisfying note. Beyond that the interior uses good materials, with only a few hard plastic touches as reminders that you bought on a budget. The comfortable front seats are matched with comfortable rears, and the driver’s controls are mostly easy to use. The exception is the dual-screen infotainment/navigation system, which some might gripe needs another pass through the ergonomics department, but others don't mind. A-Spec model seats get unique fabric and gray contrast stitching.","Acura calls its multi-lensed LED headlight treatment ""Jewel Eye,"" and it's definitely distinctive, although not everybody likes the aesthetics. The 2017 ILX adds a separate bar of LED running lights, and overall we think it's nice. The grille treatment, taillights, front and rear bumpers, and the rest of the exterior design manage to look distinctly different from the Honda Civic upon which the ILX is based, quite a trick considering they're dimensionally nearly identical. Note that the A-Spec model is appearance only, getting 18-inch wheels and a few other tweaks.","All 2017 Acura ILX models come standard with the 2.4-liter engine and 8-speed automatic transmission. They also come fairly well loaded with other features, including a rearview camera with multiple views, automatic headlights, dual-zone GPS-linked climate control, passive entry with push-button start, and an 8-way power driver's seat. Even base models get heated front seats, and part of the ILX's quiet is thanks to noise-abating wheels and active noise cancellation.","Optional Equipment 
AcuraWatch is a suite of safety systems that includes adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation braking, lane keeping assist, and other high-tech features. Elsewhere, ILX Premium models add leather seats, blind-spot warning with a cross-traffic monitor, the iPhone navigation connectivity mentioned earlier, and an audio upgrade. Also included on Premium models comes Siri Eyes Free, which allows access to the iPhone's digital assistant with the push of a button on the steering wheel. The top-line Technology Plus models get AcuraWatch standard, as well as an even better audio system and built-in navigation. The A-Spec package adds 18-inch wheels and sporty trim inside and out.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine in the 2017 Acura ILX is ubiquitous across the board, and its 201 horsepower is more than adequate for a car this size. The 8-speed automatic is one of our favorite things about the car; smooth shifting in Drive and quick when using the paddles. The 8-speed is a dual-clutch setup, meaning it's designed like a computer-operated manual transmission, but Acura also added a torque converter in the system for better power delivery and a more familiar feel. The high-tech engine uses advanced fuel injection that enhances power and fuel economy, but it also requires premium fuel. Luckily, you won't use a lot of it, thanks to 25 mpg city and 35 mpg highway EPA estimates.
 
 2.4-liter inline-4
 201 horsepower @ 6,800 rpm
 180 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/35 mpg","Pricing Notes 
 
A base 2017 Acura ILX will run you just under $29,000 when you include the $940 destination charge. Move up to the Premium Package and you're looking at just under $31,000, and the Technology Plus model comes in at just under $34,000. The AcuraWatch Plus package adds about $1,300, while the A-Spec package adds about $2,000 to the price of a Premium or Technology Plus model. The ILX is priced higher than a Buick Verano, but it's also better equipped. It's also thousands less than the base model Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA250, especially when you start adding options to those other cars. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new ILX. Projected resale value for the ILX is better than the Buick, but lags behind the Mercedes-Benz and Audi competition.

If you’re looking for a luxury car that knows what the word “luxury” should mean, Audi’s A6 sedan for 2017 will likely meet your criteria. The new Competition trim delivers a sportier ride, while the V8-powered S6 is every bit the equal of the BMW M and Mercedes-Benz AMG trims.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Barring the S6, the front-wheel-drive 2017 Audi A6 sedan still isn’t as sharply tuned as rear-drive competitors such as the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti Q70. Some may find the A6’s styling a bit demure, while others will lament the lack of a V8 option on luxury trims.","Perhaps one of Audi’s most underappreciated sedans, the 2017 Audi A6 is really one of the better choices in the 4-door luxury-performance arena. Although the diesel model is dropped this year, Audi’s turbocharged 4- and supercharged 6-cylinder gasoline engines deliver impressive performance and decent fuel economy. The midsize Audi A6 offers a more comfortable rear seat than the smaller A4 without the ponderous size, weight and price of the larger A8. The BMW 5 Series and Cadillac CTS may best the A6 in the turns, but when it comes to combining a comfortable ride, dynamic handling and a luxurious interior, the A6 is more opulent than a Lexus GS, handles better than a Lincoln MKZ and is more upscale than a Hyundai Genesis.","In our time with the 2017 Audi A6 3.0T, we found the supercharged V6 had no issues when it came to acceleration, passing power or smoothness of operation. The A6’s...","Favorite Features 
 
3.0T COMPETITION
 The 2017 Audi A6 sedan’s newest trim splits the difference between the hard-riding S6 and the more luxurious 3.0T. It’s a nice compromise for those seeking a comfortable daily driver with a bit more athleticism than the base A6.
 
 QUIET, REFINED INTERIOR
 Luxury should be more than just electronic gimmicks and shiny add-ons. Audi’s A6 luxury sedan for 2017 clearly shows a level of skill and commitment to design that is often copied by the competition. But why settle for a copy when you can have the original?","","For 2017, Audi’s A6 luxury-performance series loses its diesel-engine option, but gains a new trim: the 3.0T Competition. Outfitted with a 340-horsepower supercharged V6 and a quattro sport differential, this new trim splits the difference between the luxurious 3.0 and the performance-oriented S6.; The A6’s exterior features some bold elements, such as the recently upgraded headlights, grille, front bumper and LED taillights, but overall the shape and styling remain typically","All of the usual suspects you’ve come to expect in a luxury-midsize sedan are found on the standard-equipment list. This includes leather seats (heated up front), Bluetooth phone and audio capability, automatic headlights, 18-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels, 10-speaker audio with CD player, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power sunroof and driver’s seat power lumbar and memory. BMW and Mercedes-Benz require you to check an extra box if you want leather seats in their offerings. Audi’s Parking Systems Plus with rearview camera is new for 2017, as is the S-Line exterior design treatment.","Optional Equipment 
Audi’s optional-equipment list can get a little overwhelming (and expensive) quickly but you’ll get what you pay for in terms of comfort and refinement. Things like the available MMI infotainment and navigational system include smartphone integration for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the Driver Assist package adds adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, Audi pre-sense plus, auto high beams and a top-view camera system with distance sensors. A head-up display projects relevant driving information, while Night Vision Assist can detect people or animals up to 1,000 feet ahead. The Competition trim can be equipped with S sport seats.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is just over $48,500 for a 2017 Audi A6 with 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. The 3.0T starts around $60,000, while the Competition trim bumps the price closer to $69,000. A top-flight S6 model will set you back around $72,000, but be ready to pay more than that to get the bells and whistles you want. Competing with the new A6 in the midsize-luxury-sedan arena, the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class start in the low-to-mid-$50,000 range. Other alternatives include the Acura RLX (starting at around $52,000), Hyundai Genesis ($40,000), and the Infiniti Q70 (around $51,000). Check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price for a look at what A6 buyers in your neighborhood are paying for their new Audis. In the resale market, A6s have historically held their own against their German rivals, while giving up a little ground to Japanese luxury leaders like Lexus.

If you’re looking to take pride in your American-made ride, the 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan will have you seeing red, white and blue. Every bit the equal -- and in some cases better than -- its foreign rivals, Cadillac’s CTS and CTS-V have earned a place on the world stage.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Cadillac name still has a ways to go before it reaches the same cachet as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus, but it’s not far. Those seeking a coupe or wagon variant are out of luck, while those seeking a less rigid ride might look to the Lexus ES or Lincoln MKZ.","Cadillac’s CTS and CTS-V performance sedans for 2017 continue to go unchallenged by domestic makes while simultaneously giving the Germans fits. From a set of powerful engine options to its Nurburgring-proven performance, the CTS outshines cars like the Audi A6 and Lexus GS, and pulls within spitting distance of the BMW 5 Series, including the legendary M5. The 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan is brimming with luxury and technology features, and even the entry-level 4-cylinder model offers up a nice balance of features, power, fuel economy and price. Of course, the tire-smoking 640-horsepower supercharged CTS-V remains the crown jewel in the Cadillac crest, forever changing the way younger buyers view America’s oldest luxury-car manufacturer.","Based on the excellent ATS sedan, the 2017 Cadillac CTS is stretched to accommodate more passengers and equipment.

HIGH-TECH OFFERINGS
 Today’s consumer needs constant access to the wireless world, which is why the Cadillac CTS sedan for 2017 includes both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s also a Wi-Fi hotspot and DockSpot wireless phone charging, plus the ability to monitor and encourage your teens to be better drivers.
 
 3.6-LITER V6 TWIN-TURBO
 V8? We don’t need no stinking V8 (well, unless it’s the supercharged behemoth in the CTS-V). With 420 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque, the CTS V-Sport’s twin-turbocharged V6 delivers jaw-dropping acceleration and passing power.","","For 2017, Cadillac updates the CTS’s front and rear fascia, makes improvements to the CUE infotainment system plus adds new features like Teen Driver, Cadillac Collection and a rear camera mirror. Trim lines are streamlined and a new Carbon Black package is offered on both CTS and CTS-V.; This is a sharp-looking car, and we mean that literally. The creased fenders, rippled hood and prominent new grille on Cadillac’s 2017 CTS stand out even among its talented competitors in the luxury-sedan segment. Details range from the pragmatic -- grille shutters that close to improve aerodynamics -- to pretty, such as the seamless aluminum trim around the side windows. At the rear, all new CTS sedans feature dual exhaust outlets. The ""CTS4"" badge denoting all-wheel-drive cars has been dropped in favor of a simple “AWD” badge.","The 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan is available with three engines and four trim levels: Luxury, Premium Luxury, V-Sport and V-Sport Premium Luxury. Standard on all CTS models is an 8-speed automatic transmission, rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 11-speaker Bose premium audio with three USB inputs, push-button start, wireless phone charging, dual-zone climate control, voice command, and an improved CUE infotainment system with a faster processor to make controlling its 8-inch touch screen better. Like most GM vehicles, the 2017 CTS comes with GM's OnStar communications system with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot.","Optional Equipment 
Cadillac’s 2017 CTS offers a variety of options: navigation, leather seating with heated/ventilated front seats, different grains and styles of wood trim, adaptive cruise control, an LCD in place of the standard needle-and-dial gauges, a sunroof, and tri-zone automatic climate control. Audiophiles will appreciate the glove-box-mounted CD player. On the performance and safety side there are Magnetic Ride Control, blind-spot monitoring, Automatic Parking Assist, Rear Camera Mirror, a bird's-eye 360-degree camera, and a Driver Awareness Package that vibrates the seat when the car starts drifting out of a lane, or gets too close to an object when parking.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Cadillac CTS luxury-performance sedan starts at about $46,600 for a base 2.0-liter model, including the $995 destination charge. On the opposite end of that, if you load up a twin-turbo CTS V-Sport you'll wind up well past the $70,000 mark, and that doesn't even touch the 2017 CTS-V and its $87,000 starting price. Those prices are all in line with the Audi A6, and a few thousand less than the starting prices of the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF and Infiniti Q70. Even the Acura RLX and Lexus GS start slightly higher than the CTS.

If you want a midsize-luxury sedan with all the expected premium trappings, loads of technology and an edge for drivers who enjoy engaging manners, the 2017 BMW 5 Series remains the one to beat. A pedigree spanning over four decades doesn't hurt, either.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Subjectively speaking, you might find the 5 Series' styling too conservative. If you eye a Volvo S90 or Lexus GS instead, you'll also benefit from a lower starting price and, in the case of the Lexus, higher resale value. Those seeking a V8 luxury sedan will have to wait or go elsewhere.","The BMW 5 Series enters its seventh generation for 2017, evolving the driving dynamics, premium amenities and stately style that have made it the benchmark among midsize-luxury-sports sedans for over 40 years. As is the norm, this all-new model has more power, less weight and has grown slightly. Just as relevant as the physical is the digital in BMW's executive sedan. Gee-whiz technology such as gesture control that recently debuted in the 7 Series flagship is now in the new 5 Series, and this model introduces cutting-edge features like the ability to park itself, no driver needed. If you still relish the act of driving, take comfort: The 5 Series offers more involvement than a Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Lexus GS and Audi A6.","For now, the new 5 Series sedan comes in two flavors, but whether you go with the 530i or 540i, you'll get a rewarding and engaging experience. Though small in...","Favorite Features 
 
DIAMOND SPEAKERS
 The optional Bowers & Wilkins audiophile system in the new BMW 5 Series uses diamond tweeters, which are said to be exceptional for re-creating higher frequencies. The concept may sound extravagant, but the actual sound is fantastic. On your test-drive, be sure to take a test-listen.
 
 REMOTE CONTROL PARKING
 Wanna impress friends and strangers? Step outside your car and have it park itself. Once fantasy, it's now reality in 540i models. This feature -- commanded by you via the key fob -- is especially useful for fitting the car into tight spaces where it'd be difficult to open the door.","","The BMW 5 Series sedan is all-new for 2017. Arriving first are 4-cylinder 530i and 6-cylinder 540i variants, to be followed by the 530e plug-in; We'll call the new 5 Series' exterior styling an evolution rather than a revolution. Dimensionally, it's only slightly bigger than the model it replaces -- 1.2 inches longer and just fractionally wider and taller. The 2017 5 Series remains quite conservative, and we for one don't mind that. Mercifully, there's no gaping grille up front, just the latest treatment of BMW's signature twin-kidney design, flanked by headlight housings that now meet each grille's edge. Overall the 5 Series' message is one of maturity and strength. The carryover 5 Series Gran Turismo hatchback, meanwhile, remains rather awkward and bulbous.","Befitting a $50,000-plus luxury sedan, even a base 2017 BMW 530i is a well-equipped machine. You'll get mighty fine 16-way-adjustable front seats, moonroof, navigation system with real-time traffic information, 18-inch wheels, universal garage opener and LED headlights. Standard audio is a 205-watt/12-speaker system with AM/FM/Bluetooth, USB and something that's becoming optional or nonexistent in others -- a CD player. As is oft the case with German luxury cars, a rearview camera is extra, as is a genuine leather interior. In addition to its more powerful engine, the 540i does include leather upholstery and opens the door to more options.","Optional Equipment 
Another BMW trait is a plethora of options, ranging from advanced safety systems to that diamond-infused Bowers & Wilkins audio system (see Favorite Things). A variety of driver-assistance systems brings the 5 Series another step closer to semi-autonomous driving. In addition to active cruise control and safety features like blind-spot monitoring, the Side Collision Avoidance system can steer the car to evade a vehicle drifting into your lane. The Luxury Seating Package adds ventilation and massaging functionality to the front seats. If you routinely drive in snowy, slick conditions, consider the xDrive all-wheel-drive system. Apple CarPlay compatibility is available, but $300 extra.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 BMW 5 530i model has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $52,000. The 6-cylinder 540i sedan begins over $57,000. Adding the xDrive AWD system is an extra $2,300. As is the norm for a European luxury car, prices easily zoom upward -- an extra $700 for an exterior color in anything other than basic black or white. A loaded 540i can reach $80,000. The carryover 5 Series Gran Turismo starts over $62,000. At these prices, the 5 Series sedan starts just shy of its Mercedes-Benz E-Class rival. Other competitors, from the Audi A6 and Lexus GS to the Jaguar XF and Volvo S90, all have a lower starting price. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others near you are paying for their new 5 Series. The BMW 5 Series' resale value has traditionally lagged behind that of the segment-leading Lexus GS.

While the E-Class Coupe and Cabriolet continue on as notable premium players in their own right, the enhanced dynamic sophistication, stunning interior redesign and augmented driver assists offered on the all-new Sedan and Wagon arguably qualify them as the safest, smartest and most accommodating offerings on the midsize-luxury scene today.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although the new E-Class Sedan and Wagon add notable visual flair, some may view the Coupe and Cabriolet styling as too conservative. Others might find better value in lower-cost alternatives like a Genesis G80 or an Infiniti Q70. No turbodiesels and -- for now -- just one AMG variant also may irk E-Class loyalists.","This is a transition year for the E-Class that introduces several all-new iterations to the lineup and sees others depart. Totally recast, the 10th-generation Sedan plus its late-arriving E43 AMG 4-door and new Wagon siblings become the most innovative, tech-rich models ever offered, while the Coupe and Cabriolet (detailed here) remain unchanged awaiting a similar transformation due for the 2018 model year. Beyond more sophisticated styling, the 2017 Sedan and Wagon boast a stronger, lighter and slightly larger platform, next-gen interior packaging plus the most advanced selection of safety systems and semi-autonomous driver assists available on any M-B. The recast E-Class has become an even more formidable rival to key midsize-luxo players like the Audi A5/A6, BMW 4 Series/5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Lexus GS.","The 2017 E-Class is a different-strokes-for-different-folks proposition. While the Coupe and Cabriolet still deliver a sportier albeit more conventional take on the line, the all-new Sedan and upcoming Wagon --...","Favorite Features 
 
DRIVE PILOT
 Part of the Premium 3/Driver Assistance Package on the Sedan and Wagon, the Drive Pilot suite of assists blends radar-based Distronic adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping Steering Pilot that keeps the vehicle centered even in a corner, and Speed Limit Pilot that reads and responds to posted signage to provide semi-autonomous capability.
 
 AIR BODY CONTROL SUSPENSION
 A new option on the 2017 E-Class Sedan and Wagon, this multi-chamber adaptive air-suspension setup also includes automatic 4-wheel leveling and ride-height adjustments. It allows the driver to fine-tune the chassis feel to any of three different levels by using the Dynamic Select control that’s standard on all E-Class models.","The passenger compartment of the 2017 E-Class also shows a similar split personality, with the 5-passenger Sedan and 7-passenger Wagon raising the quietness, comfort and overall accommodating ambiance of the 4-place Coupe and Cabrio to a discernably higher plane. Although this next-gen take is set off with style cues echoing those found in the flagship S-Class, leather -- now standard on the 2-door models -- still remains an option here. Beyond a more organic character, the cabin recasting nets upgraded front buckets, a 40/20/40-split-folding 2nd-row bench, more user-friendly controls/control layouts, a 12.3-inch center display screen and Comand infotainment/hard-drive navigation with touch pad.","While the 2-door E-Class models stand tastefully pat in their current wrappers, the Sedan and Wagon receive full restyles that bring each more into line with the sleeker-looking S-Class and C-Class. Their more expressive body contours and fascia designs add head-turning appeal, abetted by a longer hood and shorter overhangs. The remake also expands both track and wheelbase -- the latter dimension by a substantial 2.6 inches – bolstering their stance while enhancing packaging and dynamics. As in the past, E-Class models offer no-cost Sport and","The well-appointed E-Class cadre all complement real-wood accent trim, dual-zone climate control, power tilt/telescoping steering column, power front seats and basic mbrace Connect Mobile App services with ancillary touches like rain-sensing wipers, Bluetooth, SmartKey remote locking, ambient cabin lighting and fuel-saving Eco Start/Stop. The Coupe and Cabriolet also get real leather seating surfaces in place of M-B Tex. Depending on model, the comprehensive basic safety features including adaptive braking technology, and Pre-Safe systems are supplemented by seven or nine airbags. The Sedan and Wagon also add new Pre-Safe Sound that helps reduce potential hearing loss resulting from loud impact noises.","Optional Equipment 
The E-Class extras roster also is somewhat model-dependent for 2017. All versions offer M-B’s classic designo premium cabin appointments including supple Nappa leather upholstery, but only the new Sedan and Wagon can be upfitted with an available 12.3-inch reconfigurable main instrument cluster, 1,450-watt Burmester audio system and a cabin-quieting Acoustic Comfort Package. While Premium 1, Premium 2 and Premium 3 Packages that bring increasingly elevated levels of luxury and driver-assist/safety features also are available across the board, several Premium 3 features including semi-autonomous Drive Pilot, Car-to-X connectivity and a Head-up Display are exclusive to the redesigned Sedan and Wagon range.","Under the Hood 
 
Despite the demise of the turbodiesel-4 and twin-turbo AMG V8, the 2017 E-Class offers a broad selection of powertrains. However, for the time being, some are model-specific. The new E300/E300 4Matic Sedan arrives with M-B’s potent and torque-rich 2.0-liter/241-horsepower turbo-4, while the 3.0-liter/329-horsepower twin-turbo V6 fitted to the 2017 E400 4Matic Wagon also carries over in the E400 Coupe and RWD-only E400 Cabriolet variants. The Sedan and Wagon feature M-B’s more efficient 9-speed automatic transmission, but both 2-door models retain the existing 7-speed unit. The Coupe and Convertible continue in RWD-only E550 guise with a 402-horsepower twin-turbo V8, while the sole 2017 AMG-spec E-Class, the new E43 4Matic Sedan, matches its superbly responsive 396-horsepower/3.0-liter biturbo V6 with an AMG-tweaked sport version of the 9-speed automatic.

The 2017 E-Class lineup reshuffle sees the remade E300 Sedan become the new entry-level member of the family, opening at just over $53,000 while the E300 4Matic version kicks off around $55,600. The E400 Coupe commences just below $55,500 with the E400 4Matic starting closer to $58,000 and the E550 bumping that figure close $61,600. Those who favor their E-Class with an al fresco twist will find the E400 and E550 Cabriolet models raise the ante to roughly $63,600 and $70,100, respectively. Pricing for the late-arriving E400 4Matic Wagon starts at $63,300, and E43 AMG Sedan starts at $73,400 are definitely premium, but also retain historically robust E-Class residual values -- although the more heavily-optioned versions are likely to fare less well in the long run.

If you’re looking for a luxury car that knows what the word “luxury” should mean, Audi’s A6 sedan for 2017 will likely meet your criteria. The new Competition trim delivers a sportier ride, while the V8-powered S6 is every bit the equal of the BMW M and Mercedes-Benz AMG trims.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Barring the S6, the front-wheel-drive 2017 Audi A6 sedan still isn’t as sharply tuned as rear-drive competitors such as the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti Q70. Some may find the A6’s styling a bit demure, while others will lament the lack of a V8 option on luxury trims.","Perhaps one of Audi’s most underappreciated sedans, the 2017 Audi A6 is really one of the better choices in the 4-door luxury-performance arena. Although the diesel model is dropped this year, Audi’s turbocharged 4- and supercharged 6-cylinder gasoline engines deliver impressive performance and decent fuel economy. The midsize Audi A6 offers a more comfortable rear seat than the smaller A4 without the ponderous size, weight and price of the larger A8. The BMW 5 Series and Cadillac CTS may best the A6 in the turns, but when it comes to combining a comfortable ride, dynamic handling and a luxurious interior, the A6 is more opulent than a Lexus GS, handles better than a Lincoln MKZ and is more upscale than a Hyundai Genesis.","In our time with the 2017 Audi A6 3.0T, we found the supercharged V6 had no issues when it came to acceleration, passing power or smoothness of operation.

3.0T COMPETITION
 The 2017 Audi A6 sedan’s newest trim splits the difference between the hard-riding S6 and the more luxurious 3.0T. It’s a nice compromise for those seeking a comfortable daily driver with a bit more athleticism than the base A6.
 
 QUIET, REFINED INTERIOR
 Luxury should be more than just electronic gimmicks and shiny add-ons. Audi’s A6 luxury sedan for 2017 clearly shows a level of skill and commitment to design that is often copied by the competition. But why settle for a copy when you can have the original?","","For 2017, Audi’s A6 luxury-performance series loses its diesel-engine option, but gains a new trim: the 3.0T Competition. Outfitted with a 340-horsepower supercharged V6 and a quattro sport differential, this new trim splits the difference between the luxurious 3.0 and the performance-oriented S6.; The A6’s exterior features some bold elements, such as the recently upgraded headlights, grille, front bumper and LED taillights, but overall the shape and styling remain typically","All of the usual suspects you’ve come to expect in a luxury-midsize sedan are found on the standard-equipment list. This includes leather seats (heated up front), Bluetooth phone and audio capability, automatic headlights, 18-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels, 10-speaker audio with CD player, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power sunroof and driver’s seat power lumbar and memory. BMW and Mercedes-Benz require you to check an extra box if you want leather seats in their offerings. Audi’s Parking Systems Plus with rearview camera is new for 2017, as is the S-Line exterior design treatment.","Optional Equipment 
Audi’s optional-equipment list can get a little overwhelming (and expensive) quickly but you’ll get what you pay for in terms of comfort and refinement. Things like the available MMI infotainment and navigational system include smartphone integration for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the Driver Assist package adds adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, Audi pre-sense plus, auto high beams and a top-view camera system with distance sensors. A head-up display projects relevant driving information, while Night Vision Assist can detect people or animals up to 1,000 feet ahead. The Competition trim can be equipped with S sport seats.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is just over $48,500 for a 2017 Audi A6 with 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. The 3.0T starts around $60,000, while the Competition trim bumps the price closer to $69,000. A top-flight S6 model will set you back around $72,000, but be ready to pay more than that to get the bells and whistles you want. Competing with the new A6 in the midsize-luxury-sedan arena, the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class start in the low-to-mid-$50,000 range. Other alternatives include the Acura RLX (starting at around $52,000), Hyundai Genesis ($40,000), and the Infiniti Q70 (around $51,000). Check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price for a look at what A6 buyers in your neighborhood are paying for their new Audis. In the resale market, A6s have historically held their own against their German rivals, while giving up a little ground to Japanese luxury leaders like Lexus.

Cadillac’s 2017 CTS offers a variety of options: navigation, leather seating with heated/ventilated front seats, different grains and styles of wood trim, adaptive cruise control, an LCD in place of the standard needle-and-dial gauges, a sunroof, and tri-zone automatic climate control. Audiophiles will appreciate the glove-box-mounted CD player. On the performance and safety side there are Magnetic Ride Control, blind-spot monitoring, Automatic Parking Assist, Rear Camera Mirror, a bird's-eye 360-degree camera, and a Driver Awareness Package that vibrates the seat when the car starts drifting out of a lane, or gets too close to an object when parking.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Cadillac CTS luxury-performance sedan starts at about $46,600 for a base 2.0-liter model, including the $995 destination charge. On the opposite end of that, if you load up a twin-turbo CTS V-Sport you'll wind up well past the $70,000 mark, and that doesn't even touch the 2017 CTS-V and its $87,000 starting price. Those prices are all in line with the Audi A6, and a few thousand less than the starting prices of the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF and Infiniti Q70. Even the Acura RLX and Lexus GS start slightly higher than the CTS. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Cadillac CTS. The Cadillac's resale value is expected to be about average in this segment, trailing the standout Lexus GS.

EVs such as the Fiat 500e, VW e-Golf, Nissan Leaf, Kia Soul and Ford Focus Electric all sell for considerably less than the i3.

The i3’s open-space interior concept also separates it from the pack, as does its nearly $43,500 entry-level price tag. When equipped with its gasoline-powered motor/generator, the 2017 BMW i3 becomes a plug-in hybrid, placing it in line with the Chevy Volt and Audi A3 Sportback e-tron. The range-extender model allows the i3 to travel beyond is roughly 114-mile range while still emitting very little emissions. Although newer EVs will continue to come from GM, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla, BMW’s i3 should hold up well.","First and foremost, BMW’s i3 electric car for 2017 is about efficiency and zero emissions.

 RANGE-EXTENDER GASOLINE ENGINE
 As electric charging stations are still few and far between, it’s nice to have a backup plan should you run out of juice. The BMW i3’s 2-cylinder gasoline motor recharges the battery pack, essentially doubling the i3’s range. However, the $4,000 addition does disqualify the i3 as a zero-emissions vehicle.","","For 2017, the BMW i3 (94 Ah) receives a new, more efficient lithium-ion battery that extends its range to 114 miles, more than 50 percent over the base i3 (60 Ah). New standard features include no-cost DC Fast Charge for two years (where available), 19-inch wheels and Comfort Access.; The BMW i3's exterior is polarizing. In one sense, it is as unconventional as its powertrain. Glance at the overall design of this BMW's side windows, and you may see the shape of a bottle on its side, with the spout just over the i3's rear wheels. And like the front wheels, the rear set is pushed to the very edge of the car's carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic body. Even the doors are strange yet functional.

The Giga model has a leather-and-wool interior. Top-line Tera models feature full leather upholstery, 19-inch forged alloy wheels and leather-covered dash with Dark Oak or Light Eucalyptus wood trim.","Optional Equipment 
In addition to the range-extending gasoline engine, the 2017 i3 electric car offers other hardware and software to make your commute safer and more comfortable. Among the offerings are a 12-speaker/360-watt harman/kardon audio system and the Navigation Professional System with range assistant, real-time traffic info and Traffic Jam Assist. Other options include a new for 2017 power moonroof, forward-collision warning and pedestrian detection, automatic parking system, and a collision-mitigation feature that can automatically apply the brakes in emergency situations.","Pricing Notes

The BMW i3 is eligible for incentives and federal tax credits. At these prices, the i3 resides in a middle ground among electric vehicles. It is over $12,000 more than a Nissan Leaf, but nearly $30,000 less than a Tesla Model S. Also in this range are the VW e-Golf, Fiat 500e, Chevrolet Bolt EV and Ford Focus electric.

The system can support Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink. The Golf’s Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, blind-spot monitor, Lane Assist and Park Assist.; Despite a complete makeover last year, the 2016 VW Golf line is instantly recognizable.

If you're seeking a fuel-efficient hybrid car with a small footprint but generous interior space, the C-Max is worth a look. It has a more conservative design and is more fun to drive than its main rival, the Toyota Prius. Unlike the Prius Prime, C-Max Energi plug-in models have seating for five.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
For nearly the C-Max's $25,000 starting price, the Toyota Prius is significantly more efficient and now comes with a slew of advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. The all-new Hyundai Ioniq, meanwhile, promises fresh technology wrapped into a sleek design.","The 2017 Ford C-Max is a gas-electric hybrid car that offers good fuel economy and ample storage thanks to its hatchback design. Like its rival the Toyota Prius and the forthcoming Hyundai Ioniq, this compact Ford is also available as a plug-in hybrid, called the C-Max Energi, which offers up to 19 miles of pure electric range before the gasoline engine kicks in. The C-Max is more athletic than the Prius, but it can't touch the Toyota's fuel economy. Where the C-Max is rated at 41 mpg/city, the latest Prius earns up to 58 mpg. Yet the C-Max has a few tricks up its sleeve, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and a hands-free power-operated hatchback that rises with the swipe of your foot.","The C-Max feels solid and well-planted on the road despite its compact footprint.

 Do you like the thought of leaves spreading across the instrument cluster as a reward for your efficient driving skills? Well, ""efficiency leaves"" are part of the C-Max's customizable dual-LCD screens flanking the speedometer, and they'll ""grow"" as a way of coaching you toward efficient driving.","The 2017 Ford C-Max hatchback has a 5-passenger interior, as does its plug-in hybrid sibling the C-Max Energi, an aspect that distinguishes it from the 4-passenger Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. This Ford hybrid's voluptuous exterior design pays off inside, where headroom is generous for front- and rear-seat passengers. At 24.5 cubic feet, cargo room behind the 2nd-row seats is commendable and just shy of the Prius' roominess. The C-Max Energi, however, has roughly five cubic feet less and an awkward hump that hides its larger battery pack. Both have folding rear seats for added cargo versatility. Up front are comfortable, well-bolstered seats.","Design-wise the bulbous C-Max is more conservative than the space-oddity Prius, but we must admit that to our eyes the forthcoming Hyundai Ioniq line of hybrid and all-electric models is far easier on the eyes than both the Ford and Toyota hybrids. As for the C-Max, its rounded and mounded exterior pays off on the inside, where there is ample headroom and space for taller people and objects. Apart from badging and what looks like a fuel-cap door on the front left that hides the AC plug-in port, the 2017 C-Max Energi looks nearly identical to the standard C-Max hybrid.","In base SE form, the 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrid and C-Max Energi include dual-zone climate control, rearview camera, 10-way power-adjust driver's seat, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB and auxiliary inputs, and a Sync system with 4.2-inch center display that connects to smartphones via Bluetooth. The new Titanium C-Max models include leather interior with 10-way-power passenger seat, the Sync3 infotainment system with 8-inch touch screen, heated front seats, 9-speaker premium Sony audio system, reverse-sensing system, auto-dimming rearview mirror, push-button start and universal garage-door opener.","Optional Equipment 
If you're buying a base 2017 C-Max, we recommend the SE Driver Assist Package, which bundles power liftgate, Sync3 and the reverse-sensing system for added safety when in reverse. The new Titanium Driver Assist Package, meanwhile, adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, Active Park Assist to help with parallel parking, and the hands-free tailgate. Other options available on both models include navigation and panoramic moonroof. Unlike the Prius, the 2017 C-Max doesn't offer the advanced safety systems and driving aids such as pre-collision system with pedestrian detection and radar cruise control that come standard on the Toyota.","Under the Hood 
 
Every Ford C-Max Hybrid features a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine, a gearless continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and an electric motor to produce a combined 188 horsepower. The Energi boasts a larger lithium-ion battery pack for an all-electric range of approximately 19 miles. The standard C-Max Hybrid doesn't need to be plugged in, as its hybrid system works behind the scenes. Just fill the car with gasoline and you're good to go. You could do the same with the C-Max Energi, but you wouldn't get the vehicle's ability to travel all those miles on electricity only. For that you'll need to plug it into an electrical outlet. Ford pegs approximate recharge times at 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet or seven on a standard 120-volt outlet.
 
 2.0-liter inline-4 + electric motor
 188 net hybrid system horsepower
 129 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 42/38 mpg (Hybrid), 39 mpg combined/95 MPGe (Energi)
 
Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrid has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just shy of $25,000 when factoring in the destination charge. Titanium models begin about $3,000 more. The C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid starts just under $28,000, and the Titanium model is also $3,000 beyond that. Note that the C-Max Energi, however, may be eligible for around $4,000 in federal tax credits. With options, these prices can increase a few thousand dollars. At its starting price, Ford's hybrid hatchback is just slightly lower than the 2017 Toyota Prius, while the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid is priced nearly identically to the Toyota Prius Prime. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new hybrid. The Ford C-Max has traditionally had poor resale value.

Searching high and low for an exclusive luxury sedan that can run like the wind? The 2017 Porsche Panamera is like driving a 4-door 911, only better. The Panamera has a real back seat that can comfortably fit two adults, plus a nearly inexhaustible list of available technology and luxury features.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Despite its ground-up reincarnation, the distinctive Panamera silhouette is still present. If you were not a fan of the original, the 2017 Porsche Panamera probably won’t change your mind. Those needing ample rear-seat headroom and a secure trunk should look to the Audi RS 7 or Mercedes-Benz AMG S65.","When Porsche first introduced the 4-door Panamera, a lot of Porsche purists were put off. The design was awkward and the handling was nowhere near that of other Porsche cars. Fast-forward to the all-new 2017 Porsche Panamera, and you’ll find a re-boot with crisper styling, better performance and all the right bits to create a 4-door Porsche even the most stubborn enthusiast would be proud to own. Easily the equal of the BMW M6 Gran Coupe and Audi RS 7, the new Panamera makes the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Maserati Quattroporte feel a bit outdated. With power ranging from 440 to 550 horsepower, Porsche’s Panamera 4S and Turbo for 2017 promise impressive performance with an equally impressive suspension, steering and brake setup to match.","Where the previous Panamera demonstrated good performance, ride and handling characteristics, the new 2017 Panamera Turbo makes the old car seem like a relic. The steering is crisp and precise,...","Favorite Features 
 
BURMESTER AUDIO
 Developed exclusively for Porsche, the Burmester 3D High End Surround Sound system is one of the best we’ve experienced. Two efficient amplifiers power 21 speakers, and control over the music can be achieved via multiple settings in the touch-screen controller. There’s even an option to focus the sound to a particular seat.
 
 4D CHASSIS CONTROL
 By monitoring the driving situation in all three spatial dimensions, Porsche’s 4D Chassis Control System is able to synchronize the many electronic suspension and chassis systems to deliver the optimal blend of ride comfort and performance.","","Porsche’s 2017 Panamera performance sedan is all-new from the ground up. The styling is crisper, as are the car’s steering, braking and cornering abilities.; Porsche’s Panamera sports sedan for 2017 shares not a single panel with the outgoing model, yet it is immediately recognizable. The hood and front fascia are squared up a bit, with stronger character lines to make the Panamera a bit more menacing. The familiar curved hatchback rear end is still in place, but the rear fenders are wider, as is the car itself. The 2017 Panamera is only about an inch longer than the 2016 car, but it looks bigger and more substantial. Familiar features like the LED headlights are here, as are new toys such as the 4-position adaptive rear spoiler.","For the price, one would expect the 2017 Porsche Panamera 4S to come well equipped, and one would be correct. There’s a panoramic glass moonroof plus front and rear parking sensors, 19-inch wheels, 8-way-power adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation and a 10-speaker premium audio system. The Turbo model adds LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, 14-speaker Bose audio, full leather interior, power-adjustable steering column, Alcantara roof lining, 14-way-power front seats and heated rear seats. Performance equipment includes Porsche Stability Management System (PSM) and the integrated 4D Chassis Control unit.","Optional Equipment 
The list of possible option combinations is nearly limitless. Among the more notable upgrades are a 21-speaker Burmester audio system, rear-seat center-console touch screen, adaptive cruise control, adaptive LED headlights, Sport Package (air suspension, Sport Chrono package, rear-axle steering and sport exhaust), ceramic composite brakes, a heated steering wheel, 18-way-adaptive sport seats, ventilated front and rear seats, infrared night-vision camera, Lane Change Assist, Lane Keep Assist, massaging seats and 4-zone automatic climate control with separate air-temperature, blower-intensity and air-distribution adjustments for each seat. Porsche will also customize the Panamera’s interior to any color you like.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Porsche Panamera 4S 4-door performance sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $101,000, including destination charges. The Panamera Turbo pushes the price closer to $148,000. Adding numerous option packages and add-ons can push the price well past the $200,000 mark. An Audi S7 or BMW 6 Series Gran Sport start about $20,000 less than the Panamera 4S, while the Turbo’s pricing is well above the starting price for the Audi RS 7, BMW M6 Gran Sport and Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG 4Matic. On the flip side, an Aston Martin Rapide S starts around $200,000 and goes up from there. Check KBB's Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their 2017 Porsche Panamera, and note that residual values are lower than Lexus, about the same as BMW, Audi and Mercedes, and much better than Jaguar.

If you’re looking for world-class design, performance and luxury in a coupe that is more reasonably priced than a Maserati GranTurismo or Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the 2017 6 Series from BMW should do quite nicely.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
For the money, you can get a newer design with all the same characteristics from a BMW 4 Series coupe. An Audi S5 is also just as quick and less costly. If you occasionally need to use the back seat, the coupe’s diminutive quarters preclude it from consideration.","In the 2017 BMW 6 Series, you’ll find a trio of cars wearing the 6 Series badge, but uniquely different from one another. The long established 6 Series Coupe and Convertible offer big power and big personalities, while the 4-door “Gran Coupe” sedan delivers a more practical design without giving up a coupe-like silhouette. Complementing the 6 Series’ ample performance credentials is a stunning design language both inside and out, plus the choice of strong V6 and V8 engines to sweeten the deal. Can you find newer designs and more features in an Audi S5, Mercedes E-Class or Jaguar F-Type? Sure you can. But, they won’t carry the blue-and-white BMW Roundel or the unique driving experience only a BMW can deliver.","Be it the BMW 6 Series Coupe, 6 Series Convertible or 2017 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe sedan, BMW offers different engine and suspensions for an utterly unique driving experience....","Favorite Features 
 
ANY WAY YOU WANT IT
 If you desire the coupe-like look and feel of the 2017 BMW 6 Series, but practicality says “5 Series sedan,” then the 4-door Gran Coupe may very well be the ultimate compromise.
 
 BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM
 Music aficionados will love the 6 Series’ Bang & Olufsen audio option. With 1,200 watts of sound pouring from no less than 16 individually amplified speakers, you may never again feel the need to purchase concert tickets.","The 2017 BMW 6 Series interior received a mild upgrade last year, adding a new steering wheel and touch-sensitive iDrive controller to an already complete cockpit. With premium materials everywhere, exquisite fit and finish, wood or carbon-fiber accents, a high-end audio system and supremely comfortable driver's seat, BMW’s 2017 6 Series leaves a lasting impression. Not surprisingly, rear-seat room is tight in the coupe and convertible, but acceptable on Gran Coupes. Trunk space is largely unaffected when the convertible's top is folded.","The recently redesigned nose on the 2017 BMW 6 Series is subtly effective, with the number of vertical bars in each ""kidney"" now nine instead of 10. The rear end looks menacing when viewed head-on, which is just as it should be. But whether you choose Coupe, Gran Coupe or Convertible, a 6 Series boasts an athletic profile, defined by a long hood and a striking crease that's nearly the length of the body. M6 models emphasize aggressiveness with bigger 19-inch wheels, LED headlights and a unique rear diffuser under the bumper.","As one of BMW's higher-end models, the base 6-cylinder 2017 640i Coupe comes very well-equipped with leather and wood inside, xenon headlights, a navigation system with 10.2-inch display and touch-sensitive iDrive controller, dynamic cruise control and rearview camera. A new 650i adds a V8 engine, along with even softer Nappa leather, 20-way-power front seats, 19-inch wheels and a 12-speaker/500-watt audio system. BMW 6 Series xDrive models offer all-wheel drive, and all BMWs offer four years or 50,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.","Optional Equipment 
While there are stand-alone options like all-wheel drive available for BMW’s 6 Series for 2017, most of the desirable upgrades are divided into packages. An Executive Package adds ventilated front seats, soft-close doors and a futuristic head-up display that projects travel information onto the windshield so you can focus on the road. Definitely get the wonderful Bang & Olufsen sound system, and performance-minded drivers should check out the active steering and Adaptive Drive. The Black Accent package adds high-gloss black trim on the grille and interior trim, black tailpipes, bi-color 20-inch alloy wheels, and black Nappa leather.","Under the Hood 
 
Three engine options tempt prospective BMW 6 Series buyers. The 640i gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 that makes a robust 315 horsepower. The 650i gets a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that puts out 445 horsepower. The truly power hungry will gravitate to the 560-horsepower version of that engine in the M6. The 640i and 650i use an 8-speed automatic transmission, with either rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). M6 variants use a 7-speed automatic or 6-speed manual and are rear-drive only. To save on its thirst for premium fuel, the 2017 BMW 6 Series uses auto start/stop to cut engine power at idle.
 
 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (640i, 640i xDrive)

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the base 2017 BMW 640i undercuts some of its competition, but $78,600 -- including the $950 destination charge -- is still some serious coin. If you want a V8 engine, you'll be looking at nearly $90,000. The 4-door Gran Coupe adds about $2,000, and the convertibles add about $7,000. Want all-wheel drive? Add another $3,000. Options inflate the price quickly, and it's not hard to get to six figures, especially with M6 models. That said, the 2017 6 Series is at least competitive against cars like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe, and it seriously undercuts cars like the Maserati GranTurismo. Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the BMW 6 Series. Long-term resale value should be about the same as a Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe, but lower than an Audi S5.

The A8 doesn’t stand out like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series do, and that’s just how owners like it. With its standard all-wheel drive and choice of supercharged and turbocharged engines, the 2017 Audi A8’s performance credentials are never in doubt. The A8 may be aging, but it’s doing so well with a stunningly gorgeous interior filled with the most ostentatious features money can buy. And while we lament the loss of the TDI and W12 engines this year, there is still the superb S8 that combines all the luxury and elegance of the A8 Sport with 605 unruly horses under the hood.","Calling Audi’s full-size 2017 A8 a luxury sedan may be a bit deceptive, as this big cruiser is also quite the performer.

Among the more notable features is Google Earth 3D satellite images displayed on a crystal-clear 8-inch touch screen.","","Audi’s A8 luxury sedan and S8 performance sedan for 2017 see some minor changes to their exterior styling. What’s more important is what is not here for 2017, namely the short-wheelbase option and the TDI and W12 trims.; Audi's flagship sedan is stately but mostly reserved, eschewing the fluidity of, say, the latest S-Class for a more conservative shape. We say ""mostly"" reserved save for the front, which is distinguished by Audi's signature LED strip underneath the headlights and a massive, trapezoidal grille. All 2017 Audi A8 luxury sedans come with LED headlights and a cleanly sculpted hood. The A8 and S8’s standard length is now set at 207 inches. The performance-oriented S8 is distinguished by wide quad tailpipes, 21-inch wheels, side sills and rear diffusor.","As is par for the course among full-size luxury sedans, Audi’s A8 for 2017 comes with a long list of standard features. Among the highlights are leather interior, 18-way power-operated and heated front seats, 14-speaker Bose audio system, navigation, dual-zone climate control and sunroof. Every A8 also comes with a 6-month subscription to Audi connect, which offers in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. Quattro -- Audi's term for its all-wheel-drive system -- is also standard. In addition to a more powerful V8 engine, S8 models come with a sport differential and larger front brakes.","Optional Equipment 
Many of the 2017 A8's options are bundled into packages and include a wealth of creature comforts and some gee-whiz tech. Among the former are massaging front seats with ventilation and 22-way adjustment, higher-grade leather trim, heated rear seats and heated steering wheel. In the latter category Audi's executive sedan offers adaptive cruise control, lane-departure mitigation, and a night-vision assistant with pedestrian detection. Rear-seat passengers can be treated to a DVD entertainment system with twin 10-inch rear screens, while all can enjoy the sounds of a 19-speaker/1,400-watt Bang & Olufsen audio system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Audi A8 luxury sedan has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) beginning just under $83,500 for a 3.0T. The A8 Sport V8 pushes the price just shy of $92,500. The S8 Plus debuts just shy of $117,000. The Audi A8's starting price is less than that of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. It is slightly higher than those of the BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS and Jaguar XJ, and significantly more than the Hyundai Equus, which starts in the $60,000 range.

BMW’s 2017 7 Series sedan holds the same appeal regardless if you’re in the back seat or the front. The 7 Series’ air suspension and opulent executive rear seating make it the ideal business sedan, while its powerful engines and taut suspension make driving this limo-sized sedan quite thrilling.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although Android phones with OS 4.2 and newer can use a BMW app to run Android Auto via Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay is still off the menu. With no short-wheelbase option, the BMW 7 Series sedan for 2017 may feel too big for those who live in cramped or congested areas.","Last year, BMW embarked on a major redesign of its flagship sedan, adding more elegance, electronics and luxury while maintaining the car’s performance credentials. The 2017 BMW 7 Series sedan continues this trend, expanding the line to include a plug-in hybrid model and two high-performance trims. BMW’s latest shot at creating a groundbreaking infotainment system scores about nine out of 10, with a great interface but still lacking Apple CarPlay. There are more intuitive driver-assist systems as well as refined engine selections, including a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-6 for the 740i and 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 for the 750i. The V12 engine returns this year in the twin-turbocharged M760i xDrive, while the Alpina B7 xDrive sees a significant boost in power.","BMW’s flagship 7 Series sedan for 2017 is the largest 7 Series to date, yet every bit as nimble and athletic as one would expect of a car wearing the...","Favorite Features 
 
DISPLAY KEY FOB
 The 2017 BMW 7 Series’ Display Key fob includes a small touch screen for remote control of the vehicle’s security systems, as well as the ability to monitor maintenance schedules, fuel levels and range. You can even instruct the car to parallel-park itself while standing outside the vehicle.
 
 GESTURE CONTROL
 BMW’s Gesture Control allows the driver to respond to incoming calls or messages, adjust the radio volume or program unique commands via ordinary hand gestures in front of the display screen. The system can even route a course back home simply by pointing two fingers toward the dash.","","The 2017 BMW 7 Series’ Display Key fob is standard on all trims, while xDrive all-wheel drive (AWD) is now available on the base 740i sedan. The V12 returns with a quasi-M treatment in the M760i xDrive. The Alpina B7 xDrive is also back, with more horsepower and more standard features.; The 6th-generation BMW 7 Series sedan can best be described as an evolution of the previous model despite its all-new sheet metal and extended overall length. The twin-kidney grille is more pronounced, and it incorporates an active-shutter system to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. The profile of the car features a striking chrome accent that drops down from the front fender vent and sweeps rearward. The side glass is framed by a chrome strip and the famed Hofmeister kink at the C-pillar is incorporated into the rear door. In back are LED taillights and twin chrome exhaust tips.","The 2017 BMW 740i sedan comes equipped with 10-way-power driver’s seat (20-way seats in the 750i xDrive), 600-watt harman/kardon sound system, leather heated seats, rearview camera, iDrive 5.0 with touch pad, 10.2-inch touch screen and eight programmable memory buttons, navigation, keyless entry and start, power trunklid, soft-close doors, panoramic moonroof, 4-zone climate control, power tilt/telescope steering column, rain-sensing wipers and park-distance control. Also standard are BMW’s gesture control, wireless charging and a head-up display on 750i models. Standard safety items include BMW’s Active Protection System, which pretensions the seatbelts, closes windows and moonroof and activates post-crash braking.","Optional Equipment 
A full suite of driver assists is available: night vision, 3D surround-view cameras, rear-crossing traffic warnings, lane-departure warning and assist, frontal-collision and pedestrian warnings, blind-spot detection and cruise control with stop-and-go function. The new generation of parking assistant can automatically park the car in both parallel and perpendicular spaces and has an autonomous braking feature. Optional audio is a Bowers & Wilkens Diamond surround-sound system of 1,400 watts delivering sound to 16 speakers. An optional Panoramic Sky Lounge roof uses LED modules to light etchings in the moonroof to create a starlit-sky effect in a choice of six different colors.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 BMW 740i has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $82,500 including destination. Adding all-wheel drive bumps the price up another $3,000. The 750i xDrive starts just over $98,500, while the limited-production 740e xDrive starts just over $90,000. The Alpina B7 lists for around $138,000. The twin-turbo 6-cylinder BMW 740i compares favorably with the base 2017 Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan, which is V8-powered and lists closer to $98,000. The Lexus LS 460L starts a few thousand less than the 740i, while the Audi A8 L is about a grand more. Do check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what folks in your area are paying for their new 7 Series BMW. While this is a relatively new 7 Series, it should be noted that resale values for the big BMW tend toward average rather than exceptional.

From its Art and Science design language to its uniquely American interior, the 2017 Cadillac CT6 makes a stunning statement. The high-tech interior should hold wide appeal with younger buyers, while its advanced turbocharged engines and taut suspension may be enough to win over hardcore enthusiasts.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Cadillac’s 2017 CT6 luxury sedan isn’t offered in long-wheelbase form, making it smaller than many rivals. There’s also no V8 or diesel option, and the Cadillac name still doesn’t hold sway with many foreign-car owners.","With the creation of Cadillac’s flagship 2017 CT6 sedan, the legendary American luxury brand returns to the world of full-size premium-luxury cars, ready to challenge such heavyweights as the BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS and Audi A8. The CT6 borrows styling language laid down by the CTS and ATS sedans and places it on a wider and lower platform. Cadillac engineers poured everything they had into the car’s engine and chassis, while the interior team has outdone themselves in terms of styling, materials and features. With a total of four trim levels, rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) and four powertrain choices including a new plug-in hybrid, Cadillac’s 2017 CT6 luxury sedan is looking to take on as many challengers as possible and win.","It really doesn’t matter which engine you choose; when it comes to dynamic cornering and seat-of-the-pants handling, Cadillac’s 2017 CT6 luxury-performance sedan knows what it’s doing. Despite its larger dimensions,...","Favorite Features 
 
BOSE PANARAY AUDIO SYSTEM
 The Bose Panaray stereo system is unique to the 2017 Cadillac CT6 and features 34 small speakers strategically placed throughout the cabin. The system employs a Bose processor that utilizes the best technology from the company’s home-entertainment products, resulting in crisp highs, deep bass and seemingly limitless volume.
 
 ACTIVE CHASSIS PACKAGE
 Offered on the V6-powered trims and standard on the Platinum, Cadillac’s Active Chassis Package merges the on-demand AWD system with GM’s multi-mode Magnetic Ride Control and 4-wheel steering. The combination promotes superior agility at low speeds and better stability at high speeds.","Roomy, quiet and well-appointed even in base form, the spacious cabin of Cadillac’s 2017 CT6 sedan reflects a tasteful blend of fine leather, real wood and distinctive carbon-fiber accents that put a contemporary spin on traditional luxury. An 8.0-inch configurable instrument cluster is replaced by a 12-inch unit in the Premium Luxury and Platinum models, but all CT6s feature a more responsive version of the CUE infotainment system that includes a 10.2-inch screen and a console-mounted touch pad. Comfortable, supportive front buckets are matched with an equally accommodating 40/20/40 rear bench seat that offers an impressive 40.4 inches of legroom.","Emphasizing the classic proportions of a powerful rear-drive sedan, the 2017 CT6 features a long dash-to-axle ratio and embodies the latest Art and Science visual language reflected in crisply tailored (and primarily aluminum) body panels as well as its bold, expressive face. An evolutionary recasting of the prominent Cadillac grille wears a unique finish on the Platinum variant, but all CT6s get LED headlights framed by vertical LED light blades and LED rear lights with similar vertical orientation. Beyond model-specific 18-inch, 19-inch and 20-inch alloy wheels, trim grades are largely differentiated by detail touches like front cornering lights and illuminated door handles.","Even the “entry-level” CT6 2.0 Turbo boasts a bounty of features starting with leather upholstery, wood trim, extended-comfort 14-way-power front seats, the latest and best version of Cadillac’s CUE infotainment system, Bose Audio, active noise cancellation and OnStar with 4G LTE. Luxury/Premium Luxury adds detail enhancements like upgraded leather, Surround Sound, a wide-angle rear-camera mirror, concierge lighting and a hands-free power trunk. Platinum-spec includes the awesome Bose Panaray setup, Night Vision, digital instrumentation with head-up display, quad-zone air, Active Chassis with 4-wheel steering, an industry-first surround-view video-recording system, articulated rear seats and dual-screen entertainment plus advanced active/passive driver assists.","Optional Equipment 
Extras on the base CT6 are largely confined to the 3.0-liter V6 engine, AWD, active/passive safety touches, embedded navigation and a panoramic sunroof found in the Driver Awareness and Convenience Package that’s standard on all other models. Luxury/Premium Luxury CT6 options include the Bose Panaray audio system, Enhanced Vision and Comfort Package (rear-camera mirror, panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats/heated rear seats), Rear Seat Package (fully articulated/massaging outboard seats, dual 10.3-inch hideaway video screens) and the Active Chassis Package, while Premium Luxury also offers Driver Assistance with Night Vision (adaptive cruise, front/rear auto-braking, infrared night vision). All are standard on the CT6 Platinum.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2017 CT6 from Cadillac offers three different gas-only powerplants, all with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a new hybrid. The base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder is rear-drive only and puts out 265-horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The 3.6-liter V6 puts out 335 horsepower but slightly less torque than the turbo-four; you trade acceleration for fuel economy in this scenario. Topping the line is a twin-turbo V6 with 404 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. New this year is a hybrid powertrain that uses the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder plus a pair of 100-horsepower electric motors for a peak power output of 335 and 432 lb-ft of torque. Premium fuel is preferred by the turbo-4 and required by the force-fed six.

Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan starts just below $54,500, placing it about $5,000 over the aging XTS but tens of thousands below the most affordable Audi A8, BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Stepping up to a V6 will add another $2,000 and moving to Luxury trim pops both by about $3,000 while also introducing the first 3.0-liter Twin-Turbo variant at roughly $65,400. Moving to Premium Luxury boosts the bottom line on a CT6 into the upper-$60K range while the Platinum-spec models bump it by another $20,000 or so. Before you make your move, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price. As for resale, the Cadillac CT6 holds its value better than the Audi A8 L 3.0T, is on par with the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class but falls well behind the Lexus LS.

If you want a 4-passenger luxury sports coupe or convertible that's more exclusive than a BMW, Mercedes-Benz or even a Porsche, the Maserati GranTurismo could be the answer. This particular answer also brings jaw-dropping looks, a heavenly powertrain and the envy of friends and neighbors alike.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Downsides of exclusivity include a smaller dealer network, less-than-certain history of reliability, and lack of tech options and aids. Want a toy that's more on the sport side of the equation? Try a Porsche 911 or BMW M6. If cutting-edge luxury is your desire, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class coupe and cabriolet are stunning.","Available as a slinky convertible or sultry coupe, the 2016 Maserati GranTurismo is as much a powerful grand touring car as it is a statement of exquisite taste. Starting at nearly $140,000, the GranTurismo sits above the BMW 6 Series but isn't as extravagant as a Bentley Continental or Aston Martin Vanquish. And unlike a Porsche 911 or 2-door variants of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the rear seats in this Italian exotic are actually usable. Powered via a Ferrari-built V8 engine, the GranTurismo offers seamless acceleration, even if it isn't the fastest thing on the block. No matter. Fewer cars sound better getting up to speed, and even fewer 2-door cars can shuttle a quartet with the refinement, style and cachet of a Maserati Gran Turismo.","Whether as a coupe or convertible, the Maserati GranTurismo is a sensory delight. The 454-horsepower V8 engine offers thrilling acceleration -- especially in Sport mode -- and an exhaust howl...","Favorite Features 
 
THE SPORT BUTTON
 You'd think the 2016 Maserati GranTurismo would be sporty enough, yet the Sport button opens up the exhaust, quickens the shifts, and sharpens the Skyhook adjustable suspension for a firmer ride and sharper handling.
 
 SHIFT PADDLES
 Mounted behind the steering wheel on the Maserati GranTurismo are two long, artfully crafted shifter paddles. Not only do they give you manual control over the car's drivetrain at a single click, but they epitomize the Italian flair and design of the car with their light-alloy construction and tactile control.","","The Maserati GranTurismo coupe and convertible carry over largely unchanged for 2016.","The 2016 Maserati GranTurismo coupe remains available in three main trims: GranTurismo Sport, GranTurismo MC and the MC Centennial Edition. The base GranTurismo Convertible is called simply that. Even the least expensive Maserati GranTurismo coupe comes with that lovely Ferrari-crafted engine, 20-inch wheels and Brembo performance brakes. Amenities include a navigation system, Bose surround-sound system, integrated HomeLink garage-door opener, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and an interior that's awash in leather. In addition to the power-operated soft-top, convertible models include an automatic rollbar-deployment system.","Optional Equipment 
Unlike mainstream competitors -- or even a Hyundai Elantra -- you won't find newer features such as blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or radar-based cruise control on the Maserati GranTurismo. Believe it or not, there isn't even a rearview camera available (though front and rear parking sensors are). What you can get are unique paint colors -- some costing as much as a Hyundai Elantra -- various wood or carbon-fiber accents, and other interior/exterior treatments. GranTurismo MC models are more performance-oriented with lower and stiffer suspension and aerodynamic enhancements.","Pricing Notes 
 
You might want to bring your big wallet. When factoring in destination charge and the gas-guzzler tax, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2016 Maserati GranTurismo coupe starts over $136,000, while convertibles begin over $149,000. Options push the price higher, and if you opt for a Centennial edition with all the trimmings, you're looking at a cost well north of $180,000, or nearly $200,000 if you want the convertible. Not cheap, but neither are this Maserati's competition. If you agree that Italian passion and character make up for high-tech options, then the GranTurismo gives the Audi R8, BMW 650 and Mercedes-Benz S550 Coupe a run for their many dollars. Resale value should hold up reasonably well. Obviously, servicing dealers are fewer and farther between than with other premium brands. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price before committing to a deal on a 2016 Maserati GranTurismo.

From the ""base"" A7 to the new Audi RS 7 Performance with its 605-horsepower V8, the precision suspension is backed up with sharp steering and Audi's quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) system for a sure-footedness that's hard to beat, even from such worthy competitors as the Mercedes-Benz CLS, Porsche Panamera or BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe. Yet the A7 family is as luxurious as any of them, with a beautifully styled and high-tech interior that's covered in exquisite leathers.","Even in the ""base"" A7 with the 333-horsepower supercharged V6, the A7 never lacks for power, proven with its 0-60-mph time of 5.2 seconds. It's a great drivetrain, with the...","Favorite Features 
 
INTERIOR REFINEMENT
 Audi's well-earned reputation for interior quality is on display in the A7. Everything you touch feels good to your hands, from the knurled dials for the audio and climate controls, to the leather steering wheel. The 8-inch display that rises from the center dash when you start the car? Pure sci-fi cool.
 
 GOOGLE NAVIGATION
 Built-in navigation is great, but a lot of people prefer the accuracy of their smartphones. However, the A7 actually comes with Google Earth and traffic, making it every bit as up-to-date and accurate as your smartphone. It can even do Google Street View thanks to 4G TLE connectivity.","","The A7 diesel model disappears, but two new performance models -- the A7 Competition and the RS 7 Performance -- debut. There's also new technology, including standard Audi connect and smartphone interface, and a driver-assistance package that includes lane assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, and more.; Ever since its debut in 2012, the A7's fastback shape has been a defining element. Sure, beauty is subjective, but most agree this is a fine-looking car from virtually any angle. Audi calls it a ""sedan,"" but a rear power-operated hatch makes it a hatchback. It offers easy access to the cargo area with its 24.5 cubic feet of space. Models are visually distinguished through exterior styling, with the higher-performing S7 boasting its own front and rear bumper design, and the almighty RS 7 featuring a carbon-fiber splitter and diffusor. All models include a sunroof and electric rear spoiler.","With a base price of about $70,000, and an Audi badge on the nose, you'd expect even the base A7 to come nicely equipped. With standard features like a supercharged V6 engine, 4-zone climate control, an interior awash in leather and wood, and heated 8-way-power front seats, you'd be right. Also standard on the 2017 A7 is navigation, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring (Audi calls it ""side assist”), and a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD player with satellite and HD Radio with two USB ports. Newly standard this year is Audi connect and Audi smartphone interface, both of which enhance your smartphone ownership experience.","Optional Equipment 
There's a long list of options for the Audi A7 lineup, not the least of which is choosing among A7, S7 and RS 7. Beyond that there are massaging front seats with ventilation, and an available fighter-jet-style head-up display that projects pertinent driver information onto the windshield. The new Driver Assistance package adds active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras and a host of other technology, including Audi pre sense plus, which applies the brakes to avoid or lessen the impact of a frontal collision. A new A7 Competition model adds more power and better handling.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base 2017 Audi A7 starts just below $70,000; add $7,500 for the new Competition model. The higher-performance S7 starts at just over the $80,000 mark. If that's not enough, the Audi RS 7 starts at about $111,600, and the uber RS 7 Performance will run you $130,500. Note that's all before adding options; start checking those boxes and the price escalates quickly. The 2017 A7 splits the difference between the CLS-Class 4-door coupe on the low end and the BMW 640i Gran Coupe on the high end. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new A7. The A7's residual value has traditionally held up better than those of its Mercedes and BMW rivals.

 MULLINER PERSONALIZATION OPTIONS
 In addition to the available Mulliner Driving Specification package that comes standard on the GT Speed, Bentley’s factory-based customization division offers buyers of any Continental GT a full range of distinctive upgrades that span everything from unique paint/bodywork choices to one-off interior trim configurations.","","Refreshed exterior and interior styling bring a more contemporary look and feel to the entire Continental GT family while the option roster now includes Wi-Fi connectivity. The standard W12 GT engine also gets more power and torque plus cylinder-deactivation technology that helps boost overall fuel economy approximately five percent.; Maintaining classic character lines that have been a hallmark of Bentley Continental models since the name was introduced in 1952, the 2016 Continental family gets a major front/rear refresh that adds even more presence to their beautifully bold contours. The restyled nose features a smaller grille with a redrawn soft fascia and edgier front fenders that carry a new stylized bright badge. Out back, a more aerodynamic decklid design on all models incorporates a subtle spoiler, and a new brightwork element spans the reshaped bumper cap. The V8 S and GT Speed get more aggressive lower diffusers that highlight their performance-focused personalities.","The Continental GT family complements its model-range-specific premium leather/wood/aluminum cabin trim elements with a full array of comfort/convenience touches and power assists -- including a rearview camera and hands-free trunk activation.

Moving up to the W12 GT and Speed variants adds the more potent W12 engine and 21-inch alloy wheels while the latter model also comes with Mulliner Driving Specification quilted-leather upholstery.","Optional Equipment 
In addition to the near-endless selection of unique touches available through Bentley’s Mulliner operation and the aforementioned Naim premium audio system, the Continental GT clan offers upgrades like heated/ventilated front seats with massage function, deep-pile carpets and mats, a sport steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, carbon-ceramic brakes and 21-inch alloy wheels.

The 2016 Continental GT V8 Coupe has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $201,000, with the Convertible about $20K more. A GT V8 S Coupe and Convertible begin around $213,500 and $235,500, respectively, while the GT W12 is a bit over $216,000, and the GT Speed Coupe and Convertible commence around $241,000 and $266,000. Bentley’s extensive personalization programs can add considerably to those numbers, and while KBB hasn’t set fair purchase prices for any Continental variant, full retail represents a good starting point.

With a zero-to-60-mph time ranging from 4.4 seconds to 2.8 (Ludicrous mode), the Model S can win over the most skeptical enthusiast.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If time to spare isn’t one luxury you can afford it’s important to understand that recharging a 2016 Tesla Model S takes much longer than filling a gas tank. Those seeking an equally attractive alternative might find it in a Porsche Panamera S E- Hybrid or Lexus LS Hybrid.","Elon Musk might very well be this century’s version of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford rolled into one. In the 2016 Tesla Model S electric luxury-performance sedan, Musk has created not only a viable alternative to the traditional combustion-engine car, but a vehicle that has captured the public’s imagination. With its sleek design, impressive range and varied performance upgrade packages, the Model S should scare the heck out of OPEC. Tesla has even taken the bold step of building its own infrastructure, installing a network of “Supercharger” charging stations at various locations across the country. With performance abilities that dwarf some supercars and a price well in line with most full-size luxury sedans, prohibitive arguments against owning a Model S are few.","If you order a 2016 Tesla Model S P85D electric luxury sedan, you’ll find it comes with two acceleration settings: Sport and Ludicrous.

If you love everything about Aston Martin’s gorgeous coupes (including their ability to dash from zero to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds), but you really need the convenience and comfort of a 4-door sedan, the 2016 Aston Martin Rapide S 4-door coupe has you covered.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
For less than half the price of a 2016 Aston Martin Rapide S coupe, you could slide behind the wheel of a BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS or Porsche Panamera. Heck, even loaded these three don’t approach the Rapide S’s base price.","With a 552-horsepower V12 under its hood, Aston Martin’s 2016 Rapide S coupe is clearly built for speed. Unlike the company’s more traditional coupes, this supercar is a 4-door, 4-seat stunner with a luxury pedigree rivaling the Mercedes-Benz CLS, Porsche Panamera and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, all of which cost significantly less than the $200,000-plus Rapide S. Part sedan, part hatchback and part coupe the Rapide S defies categorization, but there’s no denying its ability to attract attention wherever it arrives. Exclusivity has its price, however, and in the case of the Rapide S that means having a much smaller dealer network to service and repair the car.","Aston Martin calls its 2016 Rapide S a coupe because attaching the word “sedan” to such a seductive machine just seems an antithetical proposition. We prefer to think of the...","Favorite Features 
 
8-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
 The Rapide’s ZF 8-speed automatic strikes the perfect balance between performance and economy. Shifts are quick, but the transmission isn't jumpy, and fuel economy can reach an impressive 22-mpg highway, as long as you don’t lay into the throttle.
 
 CONFIGURABLE CARGO AREA
 The sculpted rear seats provide a surprisingly comfortable perch for two, but when it’s just you and a companion, the rear seats power-fold at the touch of a button to provide a generous cargo bay.","The 2016 Aston Martin Rapide S coupe's cabin embodies modern elegance, with top-notch materials throughout, including full-grain diamond-quilted leather and touches of walnut. The seats offer a toned-down version of the bolstering you would find in a sports car: They're plenty supportive yet quite comfortable. There are pleasant details like glass switches, organic electroluminescent displays, and dials and buttons that are elegant and mostly easy to reach and use, with the exception of some climate-control and stereo controls that are a little small. A big plus: The electronic parking brake replaces Aston Martin's traditional (and somewhat counterintuitive) ""fly-off"" handbrake.","Despite the extra doors, the bodywork of the Rapide S makes the car fit right in with the rest of the lineup. There is no doubt this curvy looker is an Aston Martin. While the Rapide has four doors, the handles are the same color as the body so as not to compromise the lines of this car. It has a long hood profile, trademark grille, LED accent lighting -- and there's no bad angle on the body. This is one of the most beautiful 4-doors on the market.","As you would hope, this $200,000-plus car comes with a lot of standard equipment. The Rapide's fantastic V12 and ZF 8-speed automatic are in every model, as are 20-inch wheels, the 3-stage Adaptive Damping System, LED lighting, heated front seats and rear screen, and parking sensors. Inside, the Rapide comes with features such as the terrific 1,000-watt Bang & Olufsen audio system, satellite-based navigation, AMi II infotainment system, rearview camera iPod/iPhone connectivity -- and this British company would be remiss if it didn’t include an umbrella.","Optional Equipment 
Plenty of styling touches and ultra-lux amenities are offered so you can make your already-exclusive Rapide S unique. There are multiple trim finishes, stitch colors, several wheel choices, four brake-caliper colors, ventilated front and rear seats, carbon-fiber paddle shifters and a rear-seat entertainment system. And if you want to take your Aston Martin gear with you, other nice touches seem to be pulled straight from a James Bond movie: the AMVOX2 Transponder Rapide Watch, crafted by Jaeger-LeCoultre that can be used to lock and unlock the car, Aston Martin luggage and Q, Aston Martin's personalization service.","Under the Hood 
 
Aston Martin’s 2016 Rapide S coupe’s V12 engine is technically 5.9 liters, but Aston rounds it up to a nice, even 6.0 liters. Behind the smooth, robust engine is an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission that can also be operated via paddle shifters. The engine has a lovely burble that is music to a car enthusiast's ears, but this is not the vehicle for the environmentally conscious. Even though fuel economy was improved last year by more than 11 percent and CO2 levels were dropped by 10 percent, the Rapide is still subject to a gas-guzzler tax and combined fuel economy is 17 mpg.

The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Aston Martin Rapide S coupe is nearly $210,000, including the gas-guzzler tax and destination, and adding options will certainly make that price go even higher. That starting price puts it in an atmosphere far above that of the Audi A7/S7, BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, Maserati Quattroporte and Porsche Panamera, but it is possible to find a fully loaded Quattroporte or Panamera for around the same price as a Rapide S.

The 1,100-watt system designed for the Flying Spur is beyond reproach, featuring touches like separately tuned twin subwoofers to enhance bass throughout the sedan's cabin.
 
 MASSAGING SEATS
 If a Bentley is all about indulgence, and a massage is in itself indulgent, then possibly a Bentley with massaging seats is the ultimate indulgence. Massaging front and rear seats are part of the Comfort Specification package, and, of course, the seats can be heated and cooled for further comfort.","","The 2016 Bentley Flying Spur's changes include new 20- and 21-inch wheel options. The instruments also get updated with more modern graphics, there's a new steering wheel, and a Wi-Fi hotspot system. The W12 engine now has variable displacement, saving fuel by deactivating some cylinders at highway speeds.; The lines on the Bentley Flying Spur reflect the larger and more expensive Mulsanne flagship sedan. There are long, flowing lines that sweep to a wide rear pillar, all of it conveying an impression of strength and solidity. There isn't a lot of ornamentation, at least not extraneous things. The four headlights float in the sheet metal, surrounded by LEDs, and even the grille itself, despite being a chrome mass nearly three feet across, is somehow subdued. It's an elegant, head-turning car that looks good coming and going, or just sitting still.","That big price tag gets you a big sedan, filled with big-ticket items. The interior is awash in wood and leather, the front seats are power-adjustable 14 different ways, and there are multi-zone climate control, bright bi-xenon headlights, a turbocharged V8 and standard all-wheel drive. The infotainment system standard on the Flying Spur features an AM/FM/CD/DVD player that plays through an 8-channel/8-speaker audio system. Navigation is also standard as is the rearview camera. Interestingly, while Bluetooth wireless connectivity and an SD card slot are standard, there's no standard USB connection.","Optional Equipment 
Options include the praiseworthy 14-speaker Naim audio system, and rear-seat passengers can indulge with their own rear-seat entertainment system, complete with tablet-style remote control, wireless headphones and built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. Rear-seat occupants also have access to a built-in bottle cooler for drinks and snacks. The Mulliner models offer even larger wheels and finer interior details. The Bentley Flying Spur offers adaptive cruise control, but curiously, neither blind-spot monitoring nor lane-departure warning -- features common on modern budget compacts -- is available.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a so-called ""base"" 2016 Bentley Flying Spur comes in at just over $203,000; the more powerful W12 model arrives at nearly $228,000. Of course it's easy to raise that price by tens of thousands of dollars without even trying, and if you fully load up a W12 Flying Spur with the Mulliner package, you can cross the $300,000 mark. Its starting price is less than a Rolls-Royce Ghost, but easily higher than just about everything else, including the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Porsche Panamera, Lexus LS and Maserati GranTurismo. It is in line with that of the Aston Martin Rapide S. To get an idea of specific pricing for your area, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. As such a niche vehicle, precise resale values are difficult to predict for the 2016 Bentley Flying Spur.

If you’d rather take the wheel than the back seat, the Wraith is the Rolls-Royce for you. At over two-and-one-half tons it’s no track thrasher, but you certainly have enough left over for one of those, right? The Wraith is the most driver-oriented Rolls-Royce, maybe in a long time.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Well, it costs as much as a house (in some ‘hoods, more than) and is not for the shy and retiring. You won’t go anywhere without creating a scene and everyone will wonder if you’re somebody important. (Of course; you are.) If you can’t stand that heat, drive something else.","Amazing Factoid: Significant numbers of Rolls-Royce buyers are in their mid-40s. Thus, Rolls is modernizing its act (although not reducing prices) as shown by the 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith coupe and its convertible stablemate, the Dawn. At this level, though, it’s less about the cars’ capabilities and more about the experience of simply owning one. Many high-end luxury cars (Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe, BMW 6 Series) match and even beat the Wraith on technology and performance, and for less money, but a Rolls they are not. Sign up for the Wraith or Dawn and you get unmistakable recognition anywhere, an image second to none, craftsmanship bordering on unimaginable, a wondrous 6.6-liter V12 engine and an experience that might transcend the vocabulary to describe it.","It’s well over 17 feet long and two-and-one-half tons heavy; the frivolity of nimbleness has been excised from the Rolls dictionary. The 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith exists not to connect you...","Favorite Features 
 
STARLIGHT HEADLINER
 A headliner glowing with more than 1,300 fiber-optic-light pipes sounds goofy until you sit in the Rolls-Royce Wraith. Then it seems magical and classy. Pro tip: The lights can be customized to match any night sky you prefer.
 
 SPIRIT OF ECSTASY
 It’s a little thing but we’re suckers for it. The lady with wings who flies through the air atop the Rolls-Royce grille is known as the Spirit of Ecstasy. In solid silver, she’s $6,525 extra; uplit is $4,025; illuminated is $7,850; gold plated is $10,075. We’ll take her in gold.","","For 2016 the Wraith has standard massaging front seats, Adaptive Headlights, new colors, exterior mirrors that unfold/fold with the remote, Oak Cluster wood in place of Elm Cluster and changes to trim. A new optional cast VIN plate gives an “impactful accent” when the door opens.; Starting with the unmistakable Rolls-Royce grille and the winged Spirit of Ecstasy, flowing into that long fastback shape, highlighting with that incredible swath of chrome around the windows, noticing the door handles that can only mean the doors are hinged at the rear, and it all comes together that not only is this undeniably a Rolls, it’s something special even beyond that. Even though the Wraith is aimed at the youngest end of the Rolls’ target buyer, the stunning presence of its exterior says clearly it’s for those who have already made it and are still on the way up.","As expected, the “base” 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith and its companion, the convertible Dawn, include pretty much everything you can imagine in a car. Power memory seats, 4-zone climate control, a navigation-equipped infotainment system and 20-inch wheels with perpetually upright, free-floating logos are all included as standard equipment. A wide variety of interior and exterior color choices is also offered at no extra charge. And of course there's the intangible but just as important appeal of letting the world know you're successful enough to arrive in a Rolls-Royce.","Optional Equipment 
Part of the allure of owning a Rolls-Royce is the ability to customize it to a buyer's taste, and it can result in a one-of-a-kind car. Among the options are a starlight headliner that costs over $14,000 alone, wheel packages that approach 10 grand, a probably infinite selection of paint colors and treatments, a fixed-glass roof and personalized umbrellas (just for you!) that store within the doors. An optional Wraith package lists for $39,995 -- more than enough to buy a pretty nice car on its own. Safety and tech offerings include radar cruise control, night-vision system and lane-departure warning.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith is right around $309,000; the convertible Dawn is considerably more, at about $378,000. Options and “personalization” could easily add $50,000 or more. In truth, the price of a Rolls might be less of a concern to its buyers than the price of a Honda Civic is to its customers. For example, a very well-equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class coupe is about half that, a 6 Series BMW will be one-third or less of that amount. For a Rolls, price is probably not the real issue. Before signing on the bottom line be sure and check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price, to see what others are paying for ultra-luxury cars in your area. And, while limited-production numbers mean Kelley Blue Book does not have resale information for the Wraith or Dawn, you shouldn’t buy for the investment value.

If only the finest will do. If you want a sedan that’s as enjoyable to drive as it is to ride in. If you want a car as special, as technically advanced, and as exclusive as your Gulfstream G550. If you think dismal fuel mileage is a badge of honor.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although special in every way, the Mercedes-Maybach S600 does look extremely similar to a pedestrian S-Class both inside and out. Things could get awkward at the country club valet stand, meanwhile, where the competing Bentleys and Rolls-Royces are sure to impress your fellow heads of state.","When a loaded S-Class just isn’t enough there’s the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600. It is the ultimate sedan from Mercedes-Benz, a twin-turbocharged celebration of performance, prestige, luxury and technology. Longer, more expensive and more exclusive than the run-of-the-mill S-Class, Mercedes says the flagship Maybach (pronounced “Mybach”) is designed to be chauffer driven as its expansive rear seat is where the additional eight inches of legroom and features are found. But it’s your driver who will be smiling as the twin-turbocharged V12 in the S600 makes 523 horsepower and can get the huge rear-wheel-drive sedan from 0-60 mph in just five seconds. The Maybach competes in the ultra-luxury space against such desirable competition as the Bentley Mulsanne, the Rolls-Royce Ghost and Phantom and the Range Rover SVAutobiography.","From behind the wheel, the new 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 quickly justifies its price tag. This is one of the finest-driving road cars in the world. After just a few minutes...","Favorite Features 
 
EXECUTIVE REAR SEAT PLUS
 Although the Maybach’s rear seat comes standard with power adjustment, massage and a power right footrest, this $2,000 optional package adds heated and cooled cup holders and dual power rear seats with folding tables. It makes the Maybach a 4-seater and as comfortable as any private jet.
 
 6.0-LITER BITURBO V12
 When you spend about $200,000 on a car it better have a special engine, and the new Mercedes-Maybach S600 is powered by one of the finest internal-combustion engines ever conceived. Mercedes’ spectacular twin-turbocharged all-aluminum 6.0-liter V12 is incredible in every way -- it’s incredibly smooth, incredibly powerful and incredibly thirsty.","","Everything about the Mercedes-Maybach S600 sedan is new for 2016. It’s an all-new model at the very top of the Mercedes-Benz line.; The exterior design of the new 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 is one of the car’s strengths, but it’s also potentially its biggest weakness. Long, low and wide the Maybach looks hunkered down and ready to deliver the powerful to a power lunch. It’s unequivocally attractive. And it also looks expensive, but it successfully avoids too much old-world charm once embraced by the world’s old money. The S600 looks modern. Youthful. Athletic. It looks like it’s for the next generation of moguls. More Jay Z than John D. But it also looks a little too much like a run-of-the-mill S-Class.","Essentially anything you can think of comes standard on the Maybach, including LED interior lighting for mood, 20-inch wheels and tires, a reconfigurable high-resolution instrumentation screen, a panorama sunroof, wood trim, Nappa leather on the ceiling, doorsills and console and a real IWC analog clock in the center of the dash that is modeled after one of the brand’s desirable sports watches. Also standard is Mercedes Collision Prevention Assist Plus safety system, which can stop the car autonomously from up to 65 mph. Every S600 also gets night vision and a system that will practically parallel park the car for you.","Optional Equipment 
There are several optional packages we recommend, starting with Executive Rear Seat Plus. Although the Maybach’s rear seat comes standard with heat, power and massage, this package adds heated and cooled cup holders and dual power rear seats with folding tables. It makes the Maybach a 4-seater and as comfortable as any private jet. We also recommend mbrace Connect, which gives you remote access from your phone or desktop. It allows remote start as well as remote door lock/unlock. Also spend up for mbrace Concierge, which is a 24/7 personal assistant ready to help with traffic, directions, even dinner reservations.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 is one of the most expensive Mercedes currently available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is about $192,000. Load up all the options, which of course is the only way to buy your Maybach, and the price will be around $200,000. Compared to its competition, which are all significantly more expensive, that makes the S600 an extreme value. The Rolls-Royce Ghost starts at about $295,000. The Rolls-Royce Phantom is twice as much at over $400,000. The Bentley Mulsanne starts around $300,000. Only the Range Rover SVAutobiography LWB is less, starting at about $146,000.

If you want a high-style, high-tech, high-performance luxury car, then you need to check out the Audi A7 family. Not only does it offer engine choices ranging up to a 605-horsepower twin-turbo V8, it actually comes with all the cargo flexibility of a hatchback.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
There's no getting around the fact that the A7's charms don't come cheap, with a starting price around $70,000. Alternatives include the also-versatile Audi Allroad wagon and A6 sedan, both of which start tens of thousands less. There's also the smaller BMW X4 and 3 Series Gran Turismo.","With a variety of engines, plentiful options and head-turning style, the Audi A7, S7, and mighty RS 7 is the world's most desirable family of hatchbacks. But make no mistake, the practicality is only secondary: The Audi A7 is about lust, from the styling to the driving. From the ""base"" A7 to the new Audi RS 7 Performance with its 605-horsepower V8, the precision suspension is backed up with sharp steering and Audi's quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) system for a sure-footedness that's hard to beat, even from such worthy competitors as the Mercedes-Benz CLS, Porsche Panamera or BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe. Yet the A7 family is as luxurious as any of them, with a beautifully styled and high-tech interior that's covered in exquisite leathers.","Even in the ""base"" A7 with the 333-horsepower supercharged V6, the A7 never lacks for power, proven with its 0-60-mph time of 5.2 seconds. It's a great drivetrain, with the...","Favorite Features 
 
INTERIOR REFINEMENT
 Audi's well-earned reputation for interior quality is on display in the A7. Everything you touch feels good to your hands, from the knurled dials for the audio and climate controls, to the leather steering wheel. The 8-inch display that rises from the center dash when you start the car? Pure sci-fi cool.
 
 GOOGLE NAVIGATION
 Built-in navigation is great, but a lot of people prefer the accuracy of their smartphones. However, the A7 actually comes with Google Earth and traffic, making it every bit as up-to-date and accurate as your smartphone. It can even do Google Street View thanks to 4G TLE connectivity.","","The A7 diesel model disappears, but two new performance models -- the A7 Competition and the RS 7 Performance -- debut. There's also new technology, including standard Audi connect and smartphone interface, and a driver-assistance package that includes lane assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, and more.; Ever since its debut in 2012, the A7's fastback shape has been a defining element. Sure, beauty is subjective, but most agree this is a fine-looking car from virtually any angle. Audi calls it a ""sedan,"" but a rear power-operated hatch makes it a hatchback. It offers easy access to the cargo area with its 24.5 cubic feet of space. Models are visually distinguished through exterior styling, with the higher-performing S7 boasting its own front and rear bumper design, and the almighty RS 7 featuring a carbon-fiber splitter and diffusor. All models include a sunroof and electric rear spoiler.","With a base price of about $70,000, and an Audi badge on the nose, you'd expect even the base A7 to come nicely equipped. With standard features like a supercharged V6 engine, 4-zone climate control, an interior awash in leather and wood, and heated 8-way-power front seats, you'd be right. Also standard on the 2017 A7 is navigation, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring (Audi calls it ""side assist”), and a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD player with satellite and HD Radio with two USB ports. Newly standard this year is Audi connect and Audi smartphone interface, both of which enhance your smartphone ownership experience.","Optional Equipment 
There's a long list of options for the Audi A7 lineup, not the least of which is choosing among A7, S7 and RS 7. Beyond that there are massaging front seats with ventilation, and an available fighter-jet-style head-up display that projects pertinent driver information onto the windshield. The new Driver Assistance package adds active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras and a host of other technology, including Audi pre sense plus, which applies the brakes to avoid or lessen the impact of a frontal collision. A new A7 Competition model adds more power and better handling.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base 2017 Audi A7 starts just below $70,000; add $7,500 for the new Competition model. The higher-performance S7 starts at just over the $80,000 mark. If that's not enough, the Audi RS 7 starts at about $111,600, and the uber RS 7 Performance will run you $130,500. Note that's all before adding options; start checking those boxes and the price escalates quickly. The 2017 A7 splits the difference between the CLS-Class 4-door coupe on the low end and the BMW 640i Gran Coupe on the high end. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new A7. The A7's residual value has traditionally held up better than those of its Mercedes and BMW rivals.

Separating rear-seat passengers is a wood-trimmed console table with controls for climate, audio and the Blue-ray entertainment system.","","With the exception of two new special-edition packages, the 2017 Lexus LS 460 carries over unchanged. The hybrid LS 600h is dropped.; The wide grille, bulging hood and distinctive rear make the 2017 model the most radical-looking LS to date although, compared to some other Lexus offerings, it's appropriately restrained. The long-wheelbase LS 460 L hides its length, if not considerable image, well. On the other hand, the LS 460 F Sport, with its aggressive front and rear ends, 10-millimeter-reduced ride height and 19-inch wheels stands out in the crowd. The LS 460, in all forms, is a good-sized, impressive-looking luxury sedan and no parking valet will miss the big L in the middle of the grille.","Standard equipment on the thoroughly equipped 2017 Lexus LS 460 includes 18-inch wheels with hollow spokes that reduce noise, power door closers, grain-matched wood trim, a 12.3-inch display screen, TFT (Thin Film Transistor) color multi-information display, individual rear-seat vanity mirrors, parking sensors and rearview camera, power tilt-and-slide moonroof, and Lexus (SD memory card-based) Navigation with a wide range of features, conveniences, integrated smartphone apps and data services. On balance, we can easily recommend the standard-issue LS 460; we like its blend of moderate size and generous luxury and, with its extensive complement of features, it represents excellent value for the money.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Lexus LS 460 offers an extensive list of options. For demanding audiophiles we recommend the 19-speaker Mark Levinson Reference Surround Sound system. Packages include the Ultra Luxury Package, F Sport Package, Adaptive Variable Air Suspension Package, the Comfort Package and the Executive Seating Package; notice, most of these are to enhance the already-impressive luxury and convenience attributes of the LS. Safety-related options include the Lexus Advanced Pre-Collision Package, which sounds an alert if the driver isn't paying attention; adaptive cruise control, which maintains a preset distance behind the vehicle ahead; and a pedestrian-detection and pre-collision system.","Pricing Notes

If you want one of the most extreme SUVs money can buy – regardless of price, fuel economy and ride comfort – say hello to the 2016 G-Class. Few luxury SUVs are as brash, and this one has all the capability you could desire to back up its bold looks.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2016 G-Wagen has all the leather, safety features and power you could desire, but it's not very comfortable. A Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne, BMW X5, Audi Q7 and the new Bentley Bentayga ultra-luxury SUV have more refined rides and are easier to live with in general.","As Mercedes-Benz's toughest and most exclusive SUV, the 2016 G-Class has the luxury credentials and cachet that come with a 6-figure SUV, yet retains the essence, style and hardware of ancestors better known for transporting military troops than Hollywood socialites. Also known as the G-Wagen, this is a real-deal off-roader. With triple-locking differentials, a turbocharged V8 and rugged frame, the G-Class could take you to the ends of the earth. But as with luxury SUV rivals like the Range Rover and Lexus LX 570, one can only smile at the irony that 99 percent of its 1-percenter owners will never leave asphalt. Few vehicles exude the bravado of the G-Class, and the new, roughly $220,000 V12-powered AMG G65 takes things to a whole new level.","Good news/bad news: The Mercedes-Benz G-Class will take you anywhere you want to go, from the base of a volcano to the top of Vail, but the ride to either...","Favorite Features 
 
UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE 
Face it: Most SUVs have gone soft, trading their truck-based frames and low-range gearing for sedan-like platforms that drive like, well, sedans. But the G-Class bucks all that to remain much the same as it has for four decades – a bold, sturdy, go-anywhere vehicle. 
 
V12-POWERED AMG G65 
About the only way for Mercedes to make the G-Class even more extreme was to implant it with a twin-turbocharged V12 engine, the way it has done with range-topping vehicles like the S-Class. Mercedes has done just that with the G65, making it one of the few modern V12-powered SUVs.","","If the standard, G550 and higher-end AMG G63 are not excessive enough, plutocrats can opt for the new AMG G65. Costing nearly $220,000, this top-line G-Class boasts a twin-turbo V12 with a prodigious 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The plebian G550, meanwhile, now uses a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8.","Even if you spend the least on a ""base"" G550, you're still getting a luxury SUV befitting its $120,000 price tag. Highlights include power sunroof, dual-zone climate control and Mercedes' COMAND system that bundles navigation, harman/kardon audio system and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Other safety and convenience features include blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, heated and ventilated front seats, and leather and wood interior. Also standard: The intangible confidence/ego gained from driving a vehicle that could crush almost any environment.","Optional Equipment 
The AMG G63 adds a more powerful V8 engine, 20-inch wheels (vs. 19 on the G550), high-performance braking system and sport exhaust and supple Designo wood and leather interior. The King Kong AMG G65 boasts a V12 engine, AMG front seats and Designo-exclusive Nappa leather interior and 21-inch wheels. Other options include a rear-seat entertainment system with twin LCD monitors, heated steering wheel, and electronically adjustable suspension in the G550. Also available are subscriptions to mbrace, Mercedes' suite of mobile apps, concierge and other services.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2016 Mercedes-Benz G-Class luxury SUV is over $120,000 for the G550 and over $140,000 for the AMG G63. The new 2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG 65 starts just shy of $220,000. Add in the AMG Performance Studio Package, and that's another $20,000 alone. At these prices, the G-Wagen is among the most expensive SUVs out there, but those with money to burn can also easily spend $100,000 to even $200,000 on a super-luxe Range Rover or Porsche Cayenne Turbo.

EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITIES
 The Range Rover's off-road capabilities are like the 200-mph top speed of an exotic sports car: You may never actually use it, but it's why you own it. Besides, engineering that kind of ability into the Range Rover is what makes it one-of-a-kind even on the road.
 
 ENGINE CHOICES
 There are three different engines to choose from, with five different horsepower levels, each with its own character. Whether you want the fuel-efficient 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6, the sensible gasoline-burning 3.0-liter supercharged V6 of either 340 or 380 horsepower, or the 5.0-liter V8 of 510 or 550 horsepower, you don't lack for choices.","","The 2017 Land Rover Range Rover SVAutobiography Dynamic joins the lineup, with a 550-horsepower V8 engine, and a suspension setup that increases on-road handling without compromising off-road ability. There is also a host of new driver-assistance systems available this year, and InControl Touch Pro is standard across the board.; The exterior style of Range Rover vehicles echoes the past, where the","Land Rover’s 2017 base-model Range Rover comes with the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 good for 340 horsepower, 4-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case and Land Rover's Terrain Response system, and roll-stability control. Inside you'll find leather seating, a 10.2-inch InControl touch-screen infotainment system, a rearview camera, and a 380-watt Meridian audio system. There are also 3-zone automatic climate control, reclining rear seats, and 10-way-power-adjustable front seats. Out back is a hands-free gesture-controlled power hatch that flips the glass half up first, then lowers the tailgate.","Optional Equipment 
Step up to the HSE model (our choice) and you get the Panoramic Roof, Oxford perforated leather, 14-way-power-adjustable front seats, heated rear seats, 20-inch wheels, a more powerful supercharged V6, and other features. If you want V8 power, the supercharged level adds the 5.0-liter V8, plus Dynamic Response, Terrain Response 2, All-Terrain Progress Control, fog lights, 21-inch wheels and trim items. The new SVAutobiography Dynamic and LWB add a 550-horsepower version of the V8, plus a specially tuned suspension and a Meridian sound system with 1,700 watts (!), 29 speakers and 3D Surround Sound. And that doesn't even count stand-alone options.","Pricing Notes

 One of the reasons the new all-wheel-drive Porsche Cayenne doesn't handle or feel like a ponderous SUV is the Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) system.

All 2017 Porsche Cayenne models come standard with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. However, there are six distinct engines to choose from. The standard Cayenne comes with a strong 3.6-liter V6 engine offering 300 horsepower; however, it's worth the extra money for the turbocharged versions, either the 420-horsepower Cayenne S or the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid employs a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6 coupled to a synchronous electric motor, which adds another 95 horsepower to the total. At the top of the line are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S delivering a whopping 520 and 570 horsepower, respectively, from a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8.

If you need to tow 7,500 pounds and want 7-passenger capacity in a luxury SUV that doesn't share its underpinnings with a lower-end brand model -- looking at you, Cadillac Escalade and Lexus LX -- then the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a compelling choice.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The GLS is very accommodating, but competitors offer more towing capability -- like the Escalade, Lincoln Navigator and Infiniti QX80 -- and others offer many of the GLS's features for less money, like the GMC Acadia and Jeep Grand Cherokee.","Since the S-Class is the Mercedes-Benz flagship sedan, it makes sense to re-brand its full-size SUV the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. The ""S"" is a little superfluous though, as the big Benz SUV is already a well-known leader when it comes to luxury, power and prestige. Whether you choose the eco-friendly diesel-powered GLS350d (delayed release), the pavement-devouring AMG GLS63 and its twin-turbo V8, or one of the models in between, there's little to deter anybody of means from considering this big Benz. The 2017 GLS also gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission (except for the AMG), air suspension, revised exterior styling and an updated interior. It all adds to an already extensive list of standard equipment, and at a price that's surprisingly fair for a prestigious luxury vehicle.","We drove the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class in Austria both on and off the pavement. On the snow-blown roads in the Austrian Alps, the 2017 GLS made short work of the...","Favorite Features 
 
BlueTEC DIESEL V6 ENGINE
 This is an excellent diesel engine, offering smooth, quiet and clean power in the 2017 GLS350 BlueTEC. It offers more torque than many V8 engines, but still gets very good fuel economy.
 
 SURROUND VIEW SYSTEM
 There's no getting around the fact that the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a big SUV, but getting around in a GLS-Class is easier thanks to the available Surround View system, which gives you a 360-degree bird’s-eye view of your surroundings.","","In addition to the new name, the 2017 GLS-Class gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission, available air suspension, a revised exterior and a new interior. Also available are new Designo interior and exterior treatments.; There's no mistaking the 2017 GLS-Class as anything but a Mercedes-Benz. While the styling updates don't amount to an all-new vehicle, they certainly give it an appearance that's more in line with the current design themes seen in other Mercedes vehicles. The grille, headlights and bumper in front are all-new, and resemble the smoother shapes we've seen on the smaller GLC-Class. In back, new LED taillights are larger and more modern, and the rear side glass has been subtly reshaped as well. New Designo paint schemes are available, as well as a range of different alloy wheels.","As befitting a luxury SUV with a starting price of nearly $70,000, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class comes very nicely equipped. Included are cruise control, a power driver's seat with memory, remote start, a rearview camera, and a power tailgate and power-folding mirrors. Dual-zone climate control is also standard, as is an audio system with a 6-disc CD/DVD changer and standard Bluetooth audio streaming. Mercedes' remote application mbrace is also standard, and comes with five years of complimentary service. Safety features include crosswind stabilization and systems that monitor for driver drowsiness or an impending collision.","Optional Equipment 
Options largely are grouped into different packages. For example, the Driver Assistance Package adds blind-spot alert, brake assist, Pre-Safe anti-collision system, active cruise control and active lane keeping. A Premium package adds illuminated doorsills, push-button ignition, plus navigation and other features available in other option packages. An Active Curve System package adds adaptive shocks, and a curve-system stability control that is just about as close to autonomous driving as Mercedes's lawyers will let the engineers get. Individual options include leather seats with super-soft Nappa leather, and an upgraded Bang & Olufsen surround-sound system that's a must for audiophiles.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS350d starts at a lofty-but-reasonable $69,000 when you include the $925 destination charge. The GLS450 starts at about $71,500, while the GLS550 comes in at just under $96,000. None of that is cheap of course, but then again, this is a Mercedes-Benz. Besides, the prices are competitive against the likes of the Cadillac Escalade and Range Rover Sport, and even when you start adding options and push the price of the GLS550 to more than $100,000, it's still on par with the BMW X5, Audi Q7 and Lexus LX 570. Prices for the AMG GLS63 haven't been set yet, but expect it to be around $122,000 before options. Check the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to see what others in your area paid for their GLS, and expect to have very good resale value, especially with diesel models.

If you fancy yourself more Richard Branson than Bill Gates, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the vehicle you’ll want to take on all your exotic adventures. Powerful, luxurious and built to withstand punishment, the G-Class may not get you there as comfortably as a Lexus, but it will get you there.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Despite its luxury name and trappings, Mercedes-Benz’s G-Class for 2017 isn’t as comfortable or safe as a Porsche Cayenne or Bentley Bentayga. If you’re looking for a combination of rugged go-anywhere credentials and the latest in safety and luxury, a 2017 Land Rover Range Rover makes a much better choice.","It may be hard to fathom, but one of Mercedes-Benz’s most expensive and rugged vehicles is also one of its oldest. Now entering its 38th year of production, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV (better known as the G-Wagen) has seen many improvements since the original, but at its core remains the same rugged beast. Not as refined as a Land Rover Range Rover, nor as spacious as a Cadillac Escalade, the 2017 G-Class confounds logic as the go-to vehicle for the ultra-rich wishing to impress their friends and enemies. Of course, most will never need or use the G-Wagen’s abilities. However, those who do venture off-road will find themselves behind the wheel of one of the world’s most capable off-road warriors.","From a capability standpoint, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV for 2017 will take you almost anywhere you want to go, from a secluded sandy beach to the most...","Favorite Features 
 
UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE
 While most luxury SUVs only hint softly at their off-road ability, the 2017 MB G-Class screams it proudly from the highest peak. You won’t find a sedan-like ride or ultra-quiet cabin in the G-Class, but you will find a tenacious off-roader that will make you the envy of the Moab set.
 
 V12-POWERED AMG G65
 The idea of wedding the track-performance genius of AMG with a nearly 40-year-old SUV might seem like lunacy, but we like it. The twin-turbocharged V12 provides more power than any off-roader could ever want, but on the street it simply furthers the G-Class’s cred.","","Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 G-Class luxury SUV gains a new off-road trim dubbed the G550 4x4. This model is raised 17 inches and widened by nine inches and features portal axles, three locking differentials and a permanent all-wheel-drive system. On the standard G-Class, improvements are limited to smartphone, designo and AMG package upgrades.; While even Range Rovers have softened their lines, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class retains the boxy, upright look it has had for decades. Aerodynamic it's not, but the G-Wagen's design is honest, masculine and pragmatic. At just 187.5 inches long, the G is actually shorter than the Mercedes GLE","Even if you spend the least on a ""base"" G550, you're still getting a luxury SUV befitting its $120,000 price tag. Highlights include power sunroof, dual-zone climate control and Mercedes' COMAND system that bundles navigation, harman/kardon audio system and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Other safety and convenience features include blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, heated and ventilated front seats, and leather and wood interior. Also standard: the intangible confidence/ego gained from driving a vehicle that could crush almost any environment.","Optional Equipment 
The AMG G63 adds a more powerful V8 engine, 20-inch wheels (vs. 19 on the G550), high-performance braking system and sport exhaust and supple designo wood and leather interior. The King Kong AMG G65 boasts a V12 engine, AMG front seats and designo-exclusive Nappa leather interior and 21-inch wheels. Other options include a rear-seat entertainment system with twin LCD monitors, heated steering wheel, and electronically adjustable suspension in the G550. Also available are subscriptions to mbrace, Mercedes' suite of mobile apps, concierge and other services.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class luxury SUV is over $123,000 for the G550 and over $142,000 for the AMG G63. Pricing for the G550 4x4 has not yet been announced. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz AMG G65 starts just shy of $221,500. Add in the AMG Performance Studio Package, and that's another $20,000 alone. At these prices, the G-Wagen is among the most expensive SUVs out there, but those with money to burn can also easily spend $100,000 to even $200,000 on a super-luxe Range Rover or Porsche Cayenne Turbo. The new Bentley Bentayga, also a 12-cylinder SUV, is expected to start around $230,000.

If you’re seeking a midsize-luxury performance sedan that shuns the overpopulated masses of BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz cars seemingly everywhere you look, the 2017 Jaguar XF is it. Outstanding driving dynamics coupled with traditional British styling form a one-two punch that’s hard to beat.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re seeking the most trouble-free ownership experience over the duration of your loan, Jaguar’s reputation, although vastly improved, still can’t hold a candle to the products of Lexus, Infiniti or Acura. The XF’s somewhat subdued interior design may also be a deal breaker.","Jaguar’s XF performance sedan for 2017 offers luxury buyers a unique way to stand out in a crowded parking lot full of BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi cars. With dramatic styling that is both elegant and aggressive, the 2017 XF is a real looker, displaying traditional Jaguar design elements that won’t have it mistaken for any other brand. And while the XF’s cockpit isn’t as lavish as in an Audi A6 or a Cadillac CTS, its simple styling and quality materials create an environment that is both soothing and easy to operate. A choice of two supercharged V6s and a new 4-cylinder turbodiesel are backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and available all-wheel drive (AWD), helping the 2017 Jaguar XF remain relevant in a very competitive segment.","We can attest that any number of premium sedans are enjoyable to drive, but only a handful have us thinking about the driving experience long after we’ve put the car...","Favorite Features

 Where once Jaguar was at the back of the line with its audio and infotainment equipment, the new InControl Touch Pro moves them to the head of the class. A customizable interface can be operated via gesture controls, and there is even an app to control vehicle functions.
 
 JAGUAR ELITECARE
 To bolster a commitment to improving quality, the 2017 Jaguar XF comes with a best-in-class warranty providing bumper-to-bumper coverage for five years or 60,000 miles. The warranty also covers scheduled maintenance, roadside assistance and includes a 5-year/unlimited miles warranty on the InControl Remote and Protect system.","The 2017 Jaguar XF luxury sedan’s interior isn't fancy or flashy. Instead, it trades chrome highlights and out-there design for a simple, straightforward interface that's tasteful and elegant. The big InControl Touch Pro system takes center stage, offering most functions through its touch-screen interface. That could be a problem, but the big screen and easy-to-see icons make using it simple. The heated and cooled seats are comfortable when cruising, and plenty supportive for those times when you just have to blast through that onramp. The rear seats are also decent, and the around-town quiet is pure luxury sedan.","Jaguar’s 2017 XF sedan isn't a radical styling departure from the original, and we're okay with that. The latest XF maintains the same basic profile, with the long hood and short trunk emphasizing the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) configuration. The grille is properly upright for better aerodynamics and to better tie it in with the","Jaguar’s 2017 XF comes as nicely equipped as you'd expect of a high-end luxury sedan. There's dual-zone climate control, cruise control, power windows and all that kind of stuff, sure. There's also an 8-inch version of the InControl touch-screen interface, start/stop technology, rear parking camera, and a 380-watt 12-speaker Meridian sound system. Other standard features include Jaguar Drive Control with its selectable modes, 3-position memory for the driver's seat, and keyless start. Mid-level Prestige models come standard with heated leather seats and navigation, while top-end R-Sport models add exterior design cues, lane-keeping assist and more.","Optional Equipment 
XF S models come with an upgraded engine, putting out 380 horsepower to the standard model's 340. Other options include the InControl Touch Pro, which adds a larger touch screen, a navigation system with a solid-state drive, and a host of other features. Also available are front and rear parking sensors, a comfort and convenience package that includes soft-close doors, plus cooled and heated front seats and heated rear seats. A Driver Assistance Pack adds adaptive cruise control, proximity cameras and traffic-sign recognition. There's also a luxury package that adds a suede headliner, among other interior upgrades.","Under the Hood 
 
With the 2017 Jaguar XF, buyers can choose from two versions of a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine and one 4-cylinder 2.0-liter turbodiesel. The first V6 is a 340-horsepower version, available in Prestige, Premium and R Sport models. Opt for the XF S and you get the 380-horsepower version. Interestingly, torque figures for both engines are identical. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel offers nearly identical torque but with vastly better fuel economy and is available on the all but the S trim. All Jaguar XF models are available in all-wheel drive, and all route their power through an 8-speed automatic transmission that offers shift-for-yourself paddles on the steering wheel. Surprisingly, despite the 40-horsepower advantage the XF S models have, there's no fuel-economy penalty, although both engines do require premium fuel.

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the rear-wheel-drive 2017 Jaguar XF 20d starts at a reasonable-sounding $48,445 when you include the $995 destination charge. The base 6-cylinder car starts closer to $51,500. That's reasonable compared to 6-cylinder versions of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (around $54,000), BMW 5 Series (around $57,000) and Audi A6 (around $59,500). Of course, prices increase the higher up the ladder you climb, and if you opt for the quicker XF S with AWD, prices start at just below $66,700, and climb up from there. Still, that's in line with its competitors from Germany, Japan and the United States, and Jaguar has the best warranty of any of them. That's a nice pot sweetener, because resale value on Jaguars tends to lag behind its competitors.

If you’re shopping for a large luxury sedan with an emphasis on power and performance, the 2017 Infiniti Q70 sedan deserves a test drive.

Power is supplied by a choice of V6, V8 or hybrid engines driving the rear wheels with the option of all-wheel drive (AWD) just a checkbox away. Long-wheelbase models offer impressive rear-seat legroom, and all Q70s are loaded with the company’s best technology and performance equipment. Still, in a space crowded with competitors like the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS and Cadillac CT6, the Q70 won’t always come in first place.","While fuel efficiency isn’t its best attribute, the 5.6-liter V8 in the 2017 Infiniti Q70 has more than enough muscle to help you forget the cost of pure performance. Even...","Favorite Features 
 
ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL
 Active Noise Control works by generating sound waves to counteract sound waves emanating from the engine compartment. A ceiling-mounted microphone listens for the offending frequencies, eliminating noise without drowning out the more pleasant sounds V8 lovers cherish.
 
 AROUND VIEW MONITOR
 With a camera mounted in the front bumper, both side mirrors and rear decklid, Infiniti’s 2017 Q70 luxury sedan can produce a 360-degree bird’s-eye view. Projected onto the large LCD display, the Around View Monitor aids when parallel parking or maneuvering crowed parking lots.","","For 2017, the Premium Select Edition is now available on the long-wheelbase Q70L.; The Q70 is at once elegant, muscular, yet understated. We're thankful that Infiniti has resisted the temptation to add a gaping grille to the Q70, a design that some rivals are attaching to every car they can produce. The Premium Select Edition aims to add a more menacing guise with dark chrome trim, darkened lower rear-bumper finisher, rear spoiler and 20-inch wheels that are also darkened. Long-wheelbase Q70 models are 202 inches in total length, compared to the standard 196.1.","Thanks to the complimentary inclusion of the Premium Package -- which Infiniti says is a $4,200 value -- even a base, 2017 Infiniti Q70 3.7 is a well-equipped sedan that packs quite a value. The sedan comes with a V6 engine, leather interior, 7-inch color display with Around View monitor, heated and ventilated front seats with 10-way-power adjustment, push-button ignition, heated steering wheel, 10-speaker Bose audio system with AM/FM/CD/DVD player with USB and Bluetooth connectivity. In addition to their extra room, Q70L models have heated rear seats.","Optional Equipment 
All-wheel drive is optional on all models except the Q70 Hybrid, which is rear-drive only. And extra rear-seat room can be bought via the long-wheelbase Q70L, also available in all forms except the hybrid. Other major options are bundled into packages and include higher-grade semi-aniline leather seating, power rear sunshade, heated rear seats, sport-tuned suspension and Bose surround-sound system. Tech and safety options include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure/prevention system, forward and reverse emergency braking, and Infiniti's innovative Predictive Forward Collision Warning, which warns the driver if a vehicle two cars ahead brakes suddenly.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Q70 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $51,000. A V8-powered Q70 5.6 begins closer to $64,000. Long-wheelbase variants run $1,500 over the standard-wheelbase versions, and AWD is an extra $2,150 for V6 models and $2,550 for V8 variants. The Q70 Hybrid, meanwhile, begins just over the $57,000 mark. Fully loaded, a Q70 can reach into the mid-$70,000 range. At these prices, the Q70 undercuts a BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT6, Jaguar XF, Acura RLX and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and is line with a V6-powered Lexus GS (but several thousand higher than the new Genesis G80). It's also higher than a base 4-cylinder Audi A6. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Infiniti. In the long run, the Q70's resale value is expected to trail that of the leading Lexus GS.

You can even opt for all-wheel drive (GS 350 only).","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Some luxury buyers may find the styling of the 2017 Lexus GS a bit too aggressive. With the exception of the GS F, the new GS line doesn’t feel quite as driver focused as a more sporting BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS, although it does offer a more comfortable ride.","As is expected of a Lexus sedan, the new 2017 GS is loaded with luxury and technology features, as well as superior long-term reliability and resale figures. Last year, the 4-door Lexus GS portfolio expanded to include the GS 200t 4-cylinder turbo and fire-breathing GS F sedan, which is powered by a 467-horsepower 5.0-liter V8. At the heart of the lineup are the V6-powered GS 350 and the more eco-friendly yet still fun-to-drive 2017 Lexus GS 450h hybrid. And to spice it up there’s an available F-Sport performance package on three of the four trim levels.

It leads with an aggressive front-end treatment with an oversized grille, deep chin spoiler and intense expression. Distinctive headlights and LED taillights fit its sporting image, as do its muscular lines, highly defined shapes and low stance. The GS 350 and 450h are fitted with 18-inch alloy wheels, while the F Sport Package and GS F add 19-inch wheels.

And if you must have the undisputed most powerful American muscle car ever, the SRT Hellcat is it.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Although the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro are smaller and lighter than the new Challenger, their strongest engines won’t crank out 707 horsepower. Still, they too offer big power and retro styling, as well as a choice of coupe or convertible body styles. The Challenger is available only as a coupe.","The 2-door, 5-passenger 2017 Dodge Challenger blends classic muscle-car flavor with modern safety and technology including a 5-star crash-test rating from NHTSA and available all-wheel drive. Its long-hood/short-deck style links back beautifully to the timelessly appealing Challengers of the early 1970s, and under-hood choices range from a 3.6-liter 305-horsepower V6 to three versions of Dodge’s legendary Hemi V8; a 372-horsepower 5.7-liter, a 485-horsepower 6.4-liter and a supercharged 707-horsepower 6.2-liter in the SRT Hellcat.

ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
 The 2017 Dodge Challenger GT is the first all-wheel-drive American muscle car offering all-weather traction for skiers and buyers in snowy climates. It’s the same AWD system found in the Dodge Charger sedan and it can be paired only with the standard 305-horsepower 3.6-liter V6.
 
 UCONNECT
 One of the best automotive infotainment systems, the new fourth generation of Uconnect is also one of the easiest to use. The new system’s larger 8.4-inch screen also allows for phone-style navigation gestures like pinch and swipe. Maps are supplied by Garmin, and the Bluetooth connects your phone almost instantaneously.","Inside, the new 2017 Dodge Challenger is pleasant, comfortable and functional. In the center of the instrument panel is the touch screen that we've liked in other Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. The retro-style gauges look fantastic, and there's a large driver-information screen nestled between the tach and speedometer. Some find rear visibility to be an issue, but there's plenty of room in front, and the rear seat can accommodate three people, although they might be snug, making the Challenger the only muscle car deserving of that claim. Even the trunk is surprisingly large and useful, despite a pretty high liftover.","From its long-hood/short-deck proportions and wide stance to retro details like hood scoops, badging and optional stripes, the 2017 Challenger bears an unmistakable family link to the Challengers that scorched boulevards and racetracks back in the day. This is a cool-looking car, one that successfully fights the urge to be overly old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern with a timeless appeal and the masculine swagger of an MMA champion. And if that swagger isn’t enough you can also get some of the bright colors with the fun names from back in the day, like TorRed, Go Mango and Green Go.","The 2017 Dodge Challenger base SXT model has a V6 engine, Uconnect infotainment with a 5.0-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB and auxiliary input, six speakers, 6-way-power driver's seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start and a host of additional convenience features. With 14 different trim levels, there are really 14 different lists for “standard equipment,” and the higher-up models are quite generously appointed. Hounds-tooth cloth seats are standard on SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker and R/T Scat Pack models. An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard on V6 models and optional on V8 models.","Optional Equipment 
Most of the 2017 Challenger’s options are grouped either by the 14 trim levels or into the 13 packages. One significant stand-alone option is the Uconnect 8.4 with Navigation, with an 8.4-inch touch screen, navigation, AM/FM/HD radio, SiriusXM radio, Bluetooth, SiriusXM Traffic and SiriusXM Travel Link and Uconnect apps; this is a feature we heartily recommend. Other options include the R/T Classic Package, Cold Weather Group, which adds heated front seats and steering wheel, Technology Group, three Sound Groups, a Super Sport Group, a Super Track Pack Group and the Scat Pack Appearance Group, complete with Bumble Bee rear stripes.","Under the Hood 
 
Standard on 2017 Challenger SXT is the 3.6-liter V6, making 305 horsepower in both rear-wheel-drive (RWD) and AWD models. Next up, the 5.7-liter Hemi in R/T and T/A models makes 375 horsepower with a 6-speed manual transmission or 372 with the 8-speed automatic. The R/T Scat Pack, 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker, T/A 392 and SRT 392 share the same 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8. Then there's the SRT Hellcat, with its supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 putting out 707 horsepower; if you want horsepower bragging rights in any crowd, and particularly under $100 grand, nothing beats the Hellcat. Available with all V8 engines is a 6-speed manual gearbox, which will be a favorite with 3-pedal drivers, but the 8-speed automatic is a quick-shifting delight that doesn't shortchange on performance.

The base 2017 Dodge Challenger SXT has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) right around $28,000, including $995 for destination; we consider that to be a lot of car for the money. The V8-powered and well-equipped R/T starts at about $34,000, while the R/T Shaker, with the cool retro Shaker hood scoop, starts around $38,000. The new T/A model starts around $38,500 and the R/T Scat Pack with the 392 starts right around $39,000. Nearing the top, the SRT 392 is over $50,000; pricey, but not bad considering the content of the overall package. But one of the strangest things to call a “bargain” is the 707-horsepower Hellcat, with an MSRP of about $63,500.

While Dodge resale values have not, historically, been wonderful, we expect the 2017 Challenger to hold its own.

Bolstered by potent engines, plus cutting-edge electronic driver assists and safety tech, the Q50 returns for 2017 with updates that build on last year's major changes. For 2016, the Q50 received an all-new gas engine lineup consisting of twin-turbo V6 engines and a turbocharged 4-cylinder, which joined the unchanged hybrid option. This quartet is tempting for shoppers who are eyeing the Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series. The Infiniti also has advanced suspension and steering choices, including a fully electronic steering system with no physical connection between the steering wheel and the front wheels. Another appealing aspect of the Q50?

 PREDICTIVE FORWARD COLLISION WARNING
 While it's important to know when the car ahead of you is making a sudden stop, it can be even more important to know when the car two cars ahead is stopping. The Infiniti Q50's available Predictive Forward Collision Warning gathers that information through sensors, giving you more time to react safely.","","Moderate updates to the Q50 include the addition of the 2.0t Sport and 2.0t Sport all-wheel-drive (AWD) models, which come with summer performance run-flat tires and sport brakes, plus a sporty styling package. A new 16-speaker Bose audio system is now available, and the Red Sport 400 gets red brake calipers.; If you are familiar with the looks of the Q50, you'll instantly recognize the 2017 model. It looks basically the same as it did last year, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. The Q50 stands out because of its beautiful curvy sheetmetal and bold front grille. The Red Sport 400 has its own styling cues, with staggered 19-inch alloy wheels and summer performance run-flat tires, red brake calipers and special exhaust tips. While 17-inch wheels come standard on 2.0t models, the new-for-2017 2.0t Sport and 2.0t Sport AWD come with 19-inch wheels and summer performance run-flats.","The 2017 Q50 2.0t comes standard with features that include power heated side mirrors, hill-start assist, cruise control, and 17-inch wheels with run-flats. The Q50 also comes with 8-way power-adjustable front Leatherette seats, but if you want leather seats, seat heaters, dual-occupant memory or navigation, you'll have to step up to another trim level. Infiniti's active trace-control cornering safety system, ventilated disc brakes, LED headlights with auto mode, LED fog lights and DRLs are standard. So are Bluetooth, RearView Monitor, leather steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, auto-up/down windows and dual display screens.","Optional Equipment 
If you want a moonroof, you'll be looking at the Q50's list of options and packages. Also on that list are Infiniti's fantastic Around View 360-degree monitor, climate control with the Plasmacluster air purifier, rear sonar system, navigation, Intelligent Cruise Control, lane-departure warning, blind-spot warning, and adaptive front lighting with auto-leveling headlights. Direct Adaptive Steering will give you instant response, but you don’t need it to be happy driving a Q50. Another option to consider: Dynamic Digital Suspension. Its electronically controlled shocks reduce steering vibration and can offer a softer or firmer ride as the situation calls for it.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base-model Q50 has an impressively low price that falls below $35,000, including its $905 destination fee. Its MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) of $34,855 is the same as it was for 2016. But competition is fierce: There is a healthy 2.0-liter turbo-4 club that the Q50 enters. Members include similarly equipped entrants from BMW (the 2017 320i also starts at less than $35,000), Audi (the front-drive A4 Premium starts at just over $38,000) and Mercedes-Benz (C300 with a base MSRP of above $40,000). Moving to the 300-horsepower 3.0-liter Q50, pricing starts at $41,555. Next up is the Hybrid, which starts under $49,000. The top-of-the-line Q50 Red Sport starts at just under $50,000. Opting for AWD adds $2,000 to the bottom line of any model. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying, and note that the Q50 sedan should retain excellent long-term value.

If you imagine a luxury car should pamper its passengers, delight with technological innovation and deliver a smooth but not soft ride, Lincoln’s 2017 MKZ luxury sedan won’t disappoint. Better still, the fuel-efficient hybrid trims carry the same price tag as their non-hybrid equivalents.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2017 Lincoln MKZ is big on luxury but short on spirited handling. If you’re looking for something that can carve up curves, let you shift manually or offer the irresistible power of a V8, you’ll be better off shopping a BMW 3 Series, Infiniti Q50 or Cadillac ATS.","Lincoln’s 2017 MKZ luxury sedan gets a right proper facelift and a powerful new engine, helping this midsize-luxury sedan go head-to-head with the best from Europe and Japan. The 5-passenger MKZ offers a number of variations, including an all-wheel-drive model and fuel-efficient hybrid. Although no slouch in the curves, the 2017 Lincoln MKZ luxury sedan isn’t designed for the BMW set, but rather for those who appreciate a luxury sedan that delivers a smooth ride, a silent cabin and powerful engine. The MKZ feels more exclusive than a Lexus ES 350, more distinctive than a Cadillac ATS and more affordable than a loaded Mercedes-Benz C-Class. However, an Audi A4 or a Volvo S60 is certainly a more appealing competitor with a more substantial pedigree.","If you haven’t driven a Lincoln in the past 10 years, a few minutes behind the wheel of the 2017 MKZ midsize-luxury sedan may come as quite a...","Favorite Features 
 
PUSH-BUTTON SHIFT
 Lincoln’s 2017 MKZ luxury sedan pushes the envelope with a modern twist on an old idea. In place of a traditional shift lever, gear changes are managed via five dash-mounted buttons. Unlike the old push-button systems of the 1950s, however, this one has appropriate safeguards preventing inadvertent gear selections.
 
 LINCOLN DRIVE CONTROL
 Those who wish to have more control over their MKZ’s performance will appreciate the 3-mode Lincoln Drive Control. A choice of Normal, Sport or Comfort sets different parameters for the shock setting, transmission shift points and traction control, as well as throttle and steering response.","","The 2017 Lincoln MKZ luxury sedan gets a new Continental-inspired front end. Also new is a 400-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6. The 2.0-liter turbo gains five horsepower, and new options include full LED headlights and Driver’s package. Last year’s capacitive touch-slide controls are replaced by proper knobs and switches.; For 2017, Lincoln’s MKZ luxury sedan gets a bold new face modeled after the Continental show car. While the new grille bears more than a passing resemblance to Jaguar’s signature grille, it works to make the MKZ look more of a player in this league. Although based on the","Lincoln has positioned itself as a value-oriented luxury brand, and there's no doubt that the Lincoln MKZ for 2017 is stuffed with a lot of equipment for the price. There are heated front seats, leather upholstery, an adaptive suspension, LED taillights, and a really good 11-speaker audio system. There's also Sync 3 that uses an 8-inch display and voice-recognition software to control a wide variety of functions. Each MKZ also comes with eight airbags, stability control, and Lincoln's SOS Post-Crash Alert System that activates the horn and hazard lights in the event of an airbag deployment.","Optional Equipment 
Three equipment groups are offered with Lincoln’s 2017 MKZ sedan. Premier is the standard-issue car, but the Select group adds a rearview camera and parking sensors, plus HD Radio. The top-line Reserve group adds navigation with voice recognition, blind-spot information and a power trunk. Individual options include heated rear seats, a THX II-certified 14-speaker sound system, and your choice of moonroofs, including a panoramic roof. A Technology package adds adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and Active Park Assist. The Black Label Series brings a personal touch, with your own shopping concierge, additional paint colors and four unique interior-design layouts.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Lincoln MKZ carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $36,000. All-wheel drive adds another $2,000. A fully optioned MKZ Black Label can approach $61,000, but most buyers will be happy with a well-equipped Reserve trim that tops out around $50,000. These numbers put a 2017 Lincoln MKZ Reserve on par with the Lexus ES, but still less than a loaded BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Audi A4. While the majority of entry-level luxury sedans undercut the MKZ’s starting price, most also fail to offer a comparable level of standard equipment. To see what others in your area are paying for the Lincoln MKZ, look at our Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. When it comes to resale value, the 2017 MKZ retains residuals similar to the Acura TLX, but trails the rest of the segment by a few percentage points.

The BMW 4 Series is in reality a 3 Series coupe, and if you're looking for the driving dynamics of that sedan but in a sleeker package, you've found your ride. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe? It's as practical as it is beautiful thanks to its spacious hatch.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
It's no longer the case that BMW owns the sporty-luxury coupe market. There are the new 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe, the Cadillac ATS Coupe, the Audi A5 and S5, and the 2017 Infiniti Q60. All give the 4 Series a run for its money in style and power.","The entire 2017 BMW 4 Series family got a special birthday present for its third year: new engines. The new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo and 3.0-liter 6-cylinder turbo boast more power and torque, and come with new nomenclature; BMW 4 Series coupes, convertibles and Gran Coupe 4-door models with the 4-cylinder are now known as 430i, while the 6-cylinder models are 440i. The engine upgrades are the biggest change in a year that's otherwise defined by incremental upgrades, but that's fine, as the BMW 4 Series is already a compelling choice against the likes of the Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Lexus RC. Whether you want rear- or all-wheel drive, or the fire-breathing M4, the 4 Series blends performance and refinement with its $40,000-plus starting price.","The 2017 4 Series, like its predecessors, takes the agility, acceleration and balance of the 3 Series and augments it all with a wider stance and lower center of gravity....","Favorite Features 
 
2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE
 We said that the old base-level engine in the 4 Series was good enough that there was little reason to shell out for the 6-cylinder variant. That holds true with the new engine as well; it's more powerful, has more torque, and doesn't sacrifice fuel economy to get it.
 
 FOLDING HARDTOP
 The BMW 4 Series convertible doesn't force you to choose between a classic coupe or open-top convertible, thanks to its power-operated retractable hardtop. Top up, it's a sharp coupe with the classic BMW ""Hofmeister kink"" at the rear window; top down you have open-air enjoyment for yourself and three passengers.","","Two new engines, with horsepower upgrades, headline the changes for the 2017 BMW 4 Series lineup. More minor changes include variations on seat stitching, and an upgrade to iDrive 5.0.; The 2017 BMW 4 Series headlights flow into the ""twin-kidney"" grille, emphasizing the width of the car, while the low roof gives it a sleeker profile than the 3 Series sedan. The 4 Series Gran Coupe looks similar to the svelte 6 Series Gran Coupe, but its power tailgate opens to a large cargo area. The 4 Series convertible resembles an older BMW coupe in profile -- think 3 Series from the mid-1990s -- and its hard top offers better insulation and security than fabric. M4 performance models up the aggression with larger front air intakes, power-dome hood and quad exhaust outlets.","The base-model 2017 BMW 430i Coupe, Gran Coupe and Convertible may look different, but all have about the same levels of standard equipment. There are power front seats, adaptive xenon headlights, automatic climate control, and on the Coupe and Gran Coupe, a moonroof; the Gran Coupe also gets a power tailgate. Standard infotainment is a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB audio input, Bluetooth streaming and 6.5-inch display (unfortunately, a rearview camera still costs extra). If you want more power, opt for the 440i and its stronger 6-cylinder engine; if that's not enough, the 2017 M4 features performance-oriented brakes and differential.","Optional Equipment 
There's little that's not available on the 2017 4 Series. You can upgrade to a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon sound system, a hands-free trunk that opens when you wave your foot under the bumper, and real leather upholstery to replace the synthetic SensaTec stuff. Most options are bundled into packages, like the Technology Package that includes navigation and dedicated apps. A Driver Assistance package adds the blind-spot monitoring and Active Driving Assistant with lane-departure warning, collision-mitigation automatic braking and pedestrian detection. M4 models can bolster their performance potential with carbon-ceramic brakes and driver-selectable Adaptive M Suspension.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base-model 2017 BMW 430i Coupe or Gran Coupe is a little less than $43,000, including the $995 destination charge. A 430i convertible is right under the $51,000 mark. Prices climb quickly: 6-cylinder 440i models are about $7,000 more across the board, and all-wheel drive will add about $2,000 to whatever model you choose. And that's before options, which can easily shoot the price up to nearly $70,000. The M4 models start at more than $67,000 for the coupe and more than $75,500 for the convertible, and top out well over $80,000. That's a lot, but on par with competitors like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS, Audi A5 and S5, and Lexus RC. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what people in your area paid for their 4 Series, and note resale value will be average, lagging the Lexus RC.

If you’re seeking a comfortable and spacious luxury sedan more about safety and quality rather than flashy looks or flat-out performance, the 2016 Volvo S80 certainly qualifies.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Volvo S80 for 2016 is an aging design quickly being overtaken by newer luxury models. If you’re seeking V8 power, all-wheel drive, more modern styling and more high-tech features, any number of foreign and domestic models will prove a better fit.","Volvo’s S80 luxury sedan for 2016 may not be the first car buyers look to when shopping this segment, but it definitely deserves a look. Yes, the S80 is aging and doesn’t have the looks and latest features of cars like the Hyundai Genesis, but it is still a Volvo. For those who appreciate the subtlety of Scandinavian styling and Volvo’s long commitment to safety, the S80 will likely come as a pleasant alternative. Dig beneath the S80’s surface and you’ll find a big sedan with a modern 4-cylinder turbocharged engine and some of the most comfortable front seats in the business. All-wheel drive (AWD) is no longer on the table for 2016, a fact that may eliminate the S80 from some shopping lists.","The 2016 Volvo S80 luxury sedan is powered by an efficient and eager 4-cylinder turbocharged engine, part of Volvo’s Drive-E engine series. Refined yet powerful, this 2.0-liter has no problem...","Favorite Features 
 
CITY SAFETY 
The City Safety system uses radar to sense objects ahead of the car. Should the driver fail to take action to avoid a collision (such as when distracted by an incoming text message), at low speeds the car can slow and even bring itself to a complete stop. 
 
DRIVE-E 
Volvo’s new Drive-E 4-cylinder turbocharged engine is one of the best we’ve tested. Smooth, refined, powerful and efficient, it’s probably the 2016 Volvo S80’s most endearing attribute.","","The AWD T6 is dropped from the lineup, leaving only the front-wheel-drive T5 to carry on the S80 banner. The T5 gains new 18-inch wheels, heated front seats, a power moonroof and the interior air-quality system as standard. The Platinum trim gains BLIS, power retractable side mirrors and HID headlights with washers.; Unlike some rivals with flavor-of-the-month styling, Volvo’s 2016 S80 has classically handsome lines that will doubtless withstand the test of time. It has a graceful, sweeping roofline, and its strong shoulders, angular hood and twin tailpipes suggest some athleticism. Surrendering some function to form, those same lines toward the car’s rear create a rather narrow trunk opening. Last year’s optional 18-inch Magni alloy wheels are made standard, giving the S80 a more substantial presence. Otherwise, it's mostly carryover, with elegant highlights like Volvo's signature flowing taillight design.","All 2016 Volvo S80 luxury sedans are equipped with the City Safety automatic braking feature, leather seating, walnut wood inlays, a 7-inch color display, dual-zone climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels, rain-sensing windshield wipers, Sensus information-management system, Bluetooth, and a pollen filter. The standard audio system puts out 160 watts through eight speakers and includes an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio receiver with iPod, USB and auxiliary inputs.","Optional Equipment 
The Climate Package adds a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and heated windshield and washer nozzles, while the Technology Package includes adaptive cruise control and lane-departure and collision-warning systems. The Inscription package brings Sovereign hide perforated leather seating, leather dash, ventilated front seats and dark walnut wood trim. The Platinum trim adds blind-spot monitoring, power-folding side mirrors, front and rear park assist, a 12-speaker, 650-watt premium audio system and voice-controlled navigation system with a rearview camera plus all the features in the Technology package.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base 2016 Volvo S80 T5 luxury sedan starts just under $44,500, including the destination charge. If you start checking all the options boxes, you can quickly load your S80 up to more than $53,000. That puts it in line with some tough competition, such as the Acura TL, Lexus ES, Lincoln MKZ, and more expensive than the Hyundai Genesis. On the other hand, it's less than cars like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Cadillac CTS. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are actually paying for the Volvo S80. Over several years, the S80 is not expected to retain its value as well as the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 or Acura TL.

If you're looking for a sports coupe or convertible with power, pedigree, iconic style and an abundance of available tech/safety features and creature comforts, the 2017 Mustang brings all those to the table. That it starts around $25,000 is the cherry on top.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If horsepower is your ultimate yardstick, few production cars can match the 707 ponies of the Dodge Challenger Hellcat, which also happens to seat five passengers, one more than the Ford. The Mustang's longtime archrival, the Chevy Camaro, itself is celebrating five decades of power and is readying a new ZL1 model.","Few mainstream cars command appreciation like the Ford Mustang. For over five decades this sports car has pleased buyers of every stripe with its style, performance and attitude -- all at a price within reach of the Everyday Joe or Jane. Overhauled just two years ago, the 2017 Ford Mustang continues to bask in the glory of its past while offering today's amenities and technology. Available as a coupe or convertible, Ford's pony car offers several powertrains, from the standard V6 to an efficient yet powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder and the iconic 5.0-liter V8. Topping the food chain are track-ready Shelby GT350 models. While even those still can't out-muscle the Chevy Camaro ZL1 or Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, the Mustang has bragging rights beyond mere horsepower.","With the independent rear suspension that arrived a couple of years ago as part of its 6th-generation revamp, the Ford Mustang finally handles like a modern car.

CREATURE COMFORTS
 Muscle cars used to put brawn first, even if that meant bruising passengers. Not so with the new Mustang. Consider the heated and cooled front seats, CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and even active noise cancellation for a quieter ride. All are easily available on the 2017 Mustang.
 
 IT'S BURNOUT-READY
 Let's be honest: You know you want to. That's why the new Mustang 5.0 features a standard ""line-lock"" mode that locks the front brakes for standing burnouts. Manual-transmission GT models also include launch control for maximum acceleration.","","One of the best additions for the 2017 Ford Mustang is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone connectivity, part of the Sync3 infotainment system available across the 2017 lineup. The formerly optional Track Package for Shelby GT350 models is now standard, but it increases the price of that performance model.; With its long hood, short trunk, sloping rear glass and tri-bar taillights, the 2017 Ford Mustang could never be mistaken for anything other than Ford's pony car. Yet this is no retro-wannabe. The sleek lines, aggressive headlights and windswept design also make the latest Mustang totally relevant today. Gone is the bulkiness of the previous design, replaced with a lower, wider-looking car that, from most angles, is beautiful. Convertibles look best with the lined and insulated fabric top folded, but even when up it's still unmistakably Mustang. Active grille shutters on 2.3-liter models can close to redirect airflow, improving aerodynamics.","The least expensive Ford Mustang V6 Fastback comes equipped with a rearview camera, push-button start, Track Apps showing performance metrics like g-forces, selectable-effort steering (Normal/Sport/Comfort), 4-way manual-adjust driver's seat, high-intensity headlights and 17-inch aluminum wheels. Standard audio is an AM/FM/CD system with two USB inputs and Sync Bluetooth connectivity. Safety features include traction and stability control and front, side and knee airbags. EcoBoost trims include the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, power front seats, LED fog lights, 18-inch wheels and decklid spoiler. GT Mustangs have the iconic 5.0-liter V8, larger brakes and the line-lock feature for burnouts -- for track use only, wink wink.","Optional Equipment 
From ventilated front seats to a Shaker audio system and Brembo performance brakes, there’s a slew of options to suit your taste and budget. We're fans of the new Sync3 system, which is far easier to see and use than past versions of Ford's infotainment system, and for 2017 is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and has nine speakers and navigation. Leather interior is optional, as is blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The track-ready-but-street-legal Mustang Shelby 350R can be more like the slightly less-intense Shelby 350 by reequipping it with an audio system, rear seat and air conditioning.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Ford Mustang has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $25,545 for a V6 model with manual transmission. Opting for an automatic transmission is roughly $1,200 extra. A turbocharged Mustang with the EcoBoost 4-cylinder starts $1,000 higher, while a Mustang GT with the 5.0-liter V8 begins at $33,545 -- not a lot for a car that packs 435 horsepower. Convertibles start just over $31,000 and climb just past $43,000 with a 5.0-liter V8. The base price of a Mustang Shelby GT350 -- available in coupe form only -- has increased to $56,495, largely because the formerly optional Track Package is now standard. The Mustang's prices slightly undercut those of the Chevy Camaro and Dodge Challenger. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to get the best deal. The Mustang's resale value is expected to split the difference between the Camaro and Challenger.

The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro offers the kind of handling and braking one usually associates with high-end European sports coupes and sedans. However, it's backed up with all-American V8 muscle, and cloaked in styling that's among the best we've ever seen from Detroit.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
All this sophistication talk is about the Camaro's chassis dynamics. Inside, the hard plastics and curious ergonomic choices are not up to the same standard. Additionally, the rear seat would have to be bigger just to be tiny, and the view out the narrow windows is tough; claustrophobics, stay away.","The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro transcends its muscle-car roots, becoming something altogether new: a sports coupe so sophisticated you'd think it was born in Europe. That's because this is basically the Chevrolet version of the Cadillac ATS, a car that happens to be one of the best-driving cars GM has ever made. This newfound maturity is fitting, as this year marks the Chevy Camaro's 50th anniversary. Along with the word ""Fifty"" plastered on every model, Chevrolet is introducing two new high-performance models: the Camaro 1LE for the track-day enthusiast, and the 650-horsepower Camaro ZL1 aimed at those for whom too much is never enough. Whether you choose the 4-cylinder turbo, V6, V8, coupe or convertible, the 2017 Chevy Camaro gives the Ford Mustang night sweats.","Let's get this out of the way now: No, we haven't driven the 2017 Camaro ZL1, but with 650-horsepower supercar-grade performance, suffice to say we're excited. Part of that excitement...","Favorite Features 
 
CAMARO ZL1
 What's not to love? The 2017 Camaro ZL1 combines the amazingly powerful engine we already love in the Corvette Z06 with the Camaro's excellent chassis dynamics. With 0-60 mph in about 3.5 seconds, and the quarter mile flashing by in just 11.4 seconds at 127 mph, it's supercar performance for $62,000.
 
 4-CYLINDER TURBO
 And here we are on the opposite end of the performance spectrum. The 4-cylinder doesn't offer nearly the power of the V8, but its 275 horsepower ain't bad. Couple that with up to 31 mpg on the highway, and it's the ultimate cake-and-eat-it-too solution.","The 2017 Camaro interior is a combination of clever touches, cool styling and occasionally so-so materials. The clever touches include climate controls that reduce dash clutter by using the trim rings around the center vents to control temperature and fan speed. The design integrates classic and modern elements seamlessly. The seats offer great support in corners, and the touch-screen infotainment system incorporates Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, hampered somewhat by a too-reflective screen. The materials used are still not up to the level of the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger. We've ignored the rear seat, and after one glance, you will too.","The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro sports clean, tight lines to go with its tidy dimensions, owing a little to the classic 1969 model, but really more of an update to the previous-generation Camaro. Regardless, there's a lot to like. We love the impossibly thin headlights, aggressive fenders and low-slung roof. Camaro ZL1 models get a deep grille and bumper to feed that hungry engine, and the 1LE looks equally stunning with unique mesh grille inserts and a front splitter, plus a satin-black hood. Unfortunately that cool low roofline results in narrow windows that make it nearly impossible to see out the back.","The base-model 2017 Chevy Camaro is the 1LT, which comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. There's also a driver-selector mode that includes Snow and Ice, Tour and Sport. The 7-inch touch-screen audio system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB ports, aux input, and GM's 4GLTE Wi-Fi hotspot technology. Bluetooth, automatic climate control, and a color driver-information display between the main gauges are all standard. Upscale features include push-button start and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, and a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel. Multiple airbags and advanced stability control help keep you safe.","Optional Equipment 
Optional engines include, of course, the 335-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 on LT models or the 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 in the new Camaro SS. Other choices are an 8-speed automatic, two different Brembo-brake upgrades, an upgraded audio system with a larger touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center similar to the Corvette’s. The Camaro SS adds available magnetic ride-control suspension, power sunroof, in-dash navigation for those times when your iPhone doesn't have a signal, and a dual-mode exhaust system. That doesn't even include the 1LE track package for both LT and SS models, and of course the 650-horsepower Camaro ZL1.","Under the Hood 
 
With the Camaro ZL1 there are now four engines available for the 2017 Camaro. There's the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with a muscular 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Step up to the 3.6-liter V6, which offers more power but less torque than the 4-cylinder, and offers cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy. But a Camaro needs a V8, and in the Camaro SS there's the 6.2-liter V8 pumping out 455 horsepower. Step up to the Camaro ZL1 and you're looking at a 650-horsepower supercharged version, making it the most powerful Camaro ever. All engines connect to either a 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev matching on V8 models or an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters; Camaro ZL1 models get an optional 10-speed automatic.

The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2017 Chevrolet Camaro LT coupe starts at about $27,300, including the $995 destination charge. The V6 engine adds about $1,500 to the price, and the 8-speed automatic adds another $1,500. If you want V8 power, a 2017 Camaro SS starts just under $38,000 with a manual transmission. The all-conquering Camaro ZL1 starts a little above $62,000. Convertible models run about $7,000 higher than coupes. Thanks to a generally higher level of standard equipment, prices are pretty much on-target with its crosstown rival, the Ford Mustang, and both the Ford and Chevy cost less than the Dodge Challenger. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others in your area paid for their new 2017 Camaro. Over the long haul, the Camaro should hold its value a little better than its Ford and Dodge rivals.

If you desire a plug-in hybrid that can be powered by both electricity and gasoline – and have it in the form of a small luxury coupe – the 2016 Cadillac ELR could be just the car that fills that niche.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Practicality comes at the cost of high style in the ELR, whose rear-seat space and trunk are far more limited than its Chevy Volt cousin. The pure electric Tesla Model S, meanwhile, offers more space, better performance, all-wheel drive and incredible driving manners for about the same price.","After a less-than-enthusiastic reception, the Cadillac ELR plug-in extended-range coupe returns for 2016 with a raft of improvements and a roughly $10,000 price cut. While its sophisticated gas-electric powertrain is based on the far less expensive Chevrolet Volt, the ELR has been modified for better performance and a slight increase in electric driving range to 39 miles. Thanks to its onboard gasoline engine that acts as a generator when battery power is depleted, total range is 330 miles. The upshot of this setup is you don't have to find an electrical outlet when you run out of juice. That's the ELR's main advantage over the far roomier Tesla Model S, but some buyers may still balk at this 4-passenger Cadillac's nearly $66,000 starting price.","Our first blush with the Cadillac ELR plug-in luxury coupe left us impressed with the wizardry behind its gas/electric powertrain, but wanting more oomph when it came to power.

REGEN ON DEMAND 
Activated via steering-wheel-mounted paddles, Regen on Demand allows the driver to supplement (or in some instances, bypass) the brakes by converting rolling momentum into stored energy. 
 
SAFETY ALERT DRIVER’S SEAT 
Included as standard, the ELR’s haptic-enabled seat alerts the driver to the direction of possible hazards by vibrating different sections of the seat.","The 2016 ELR's cabin is much like its skin – sleek, sophisticated, and smaller than you may expect. The rounded dash and paneling resemble a wave flowing down, and most controls on the center-mounted command module are flush-mounted. In the center sits the high-resolution command screen for navigation, audio and app functions. This touch screen differs from others with its haptic feedback, which slightly vibrates against your finger to confirm it got the message. It's neat in theory, but hit-or-miss in execution. The ELR's 20-way front seats are comfortable and highly adjustable. The two rear seats, however, are tiny and difficult to access.","Cadillac’s 2016 ELR may just be the most stylish wedge you've ever seen. From the side, it appears to have a forward stance that makes it ready to pounce. A sharply rising beltline accentuates a similarly sloped window treatment above, while the rear C-pillars connecting the roof to the tail are thick and gently sloped. The latter adds to the exterior appeal but creates large blind spots when viewed from the driver's seat. Stylish treatments such as concealed door handles and aggressively raked front glass – along with a flush grille with active shutters – help in the aerodynamics department.","Thankfully the 2016 ELR's feature content didn't take a hit along with its price cut. In fact, this latest model gains some. Formerly optional driver-aid features such as blind-zone monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and lane-change alert are now standard. Also included are leather seating, dual-zone climate control, rearview camera, navigation, three years complimentary service of GM's OnStar Guidance Plan, 10-speaker Bose premium audio, 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi and wireless charging for certain smartphones. Along with the aforementioned driving aids, other safety features include forward-collision warning system, eight airbags and a rear park-assist system that detects obstacles.","Optional Equipment 
As a low-volume model available in just one trim, extras on the 2016 Cadillac ELR are limited. The sole package option is the Performance Package that bundles 20-inch summer tires, alloy wheels, Brembo brakes, sport-tuned suspension and sport steering wheel. The other main option is adaptive cruise control with front automatic emergency braking.","Under the Hood 
 
The Cadillac ELR continues to pair a lithium-ion battery pack with a small gasoline-powered engine/generator. But the system has been revamped for 2016 to increase power by 25 percent. The ELR's horsepower increases from 217 to 233, while its torque rating grows from 295 to 373 lb-ft. The lithium-ion battery capacity grows from 16.5 kWh to 17.1. The power boost helps cut the ELR's 0-60-mph time to 6.4 seconds. Recharging a depleted battery takes roughly five hours on a 240-volt charger. A 120-volt can also be used. And the beauty of the ELR is that as long as there is gasoline in the tank, its 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine can act as a generator. The ELR is front-wheel drive and uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

When the Cadillac ELR debuted for 2014 with a $76,000 starting price, eyebrows raised. While that lofty price may not be the only reason this luxury plug-in coupe didn't connect with many buyers, it certainly didn't help. For 2016, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) has been cut some $10,000 to $65,995. While there are many luxury hybrids and plug-in vehicles on the market – ranging from the $70,000 Tesla Model S to the $100,000 Porsche Panamera hybrid and $45,000 Infiniti Q50 hybrid – there really isn't anything quite like the ELR, as those rivals come as a sedan or hatchback, not a small 2+2 coupe. Check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the ELR. As for resale value, the ELR's prospects are unlikely to be good. The past model – even with so few sold – saw a drastic drop in its value.

Pitted against such newcomers as the Audi A7 and BMW 6 Gran Coupe, the CLS still looks fresh and vibrant, although last year’s refreshed front end somewhat diminished the original car’s streamlined appearance. As brilliant on an enclosed track as it is on the open road, the 2016 CLS coupe from Mercedes-Benz offers its owners a sense of exclusivity and envy few cars can match.

The system most responsible for the CLS-Class 4-door coupe’s responsive and linear driving feel is its electromechanical direct-steer system. The system not only improves handling, it saves fuel by only drawing power away from the engine during steering input.","","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 4Matic gains a 9-speed automatic transmission. A new Night Package is introduced and improvements are made to the mbrace Connected Car Services system, including a remote-start function. Last year’s proprietary media interface cables have been replaced by a USB port.; For 2016, the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class 4-door coupe is as distinctive as ever. Its signature roofline and shapely greenhouse give the car a flowing, uninterrupted form that extends rearward to a new, more muscular fastback profile. Recent changes to the front-end styling link the CLS to other Mercedes-Benz sedans. It is spearheaded with a larger, more ominous big-star grille, flanked by optional full-LED headlights. Body lines are sharply sculpted, and the Mercedes CLS moves further into coupe territory with its longer hood and shorter overhangs.","The CLS400 will use conventional steel springs for its suspension, with all other CLS models employing an adjustable air suspension. Also standard are 14-way-power and heated front seats, leather upholstery, automatic climate control, multi-color ambient lighting and an 8-inch audio display screen.

The CLS63 AMG S 4Matic can be equipped with carbon-ceramic brakes and Bang & Olufsen audio.","Pricing Notes 
 
For 2016, the Mercedes-Benz CLS400 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting close to $68,000. That's nearly a $13,000 leap over the equally desirable E400 coupe. Mercedes’ 4Matic AWD bumps the price up by another $2,500.

If you want an American performance icon with premium style and amenities, it doesn't get much better than the Corvette. In addition to far greater refinement, this latest-generation Vette is among the best-handling to date.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you've been dreaming of a Corvette since childhood, we doubt you'll be dissuaded. For enthusiasts still considering their options, there's plenty of temptation in the 707-horsepower figure flaunted by the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat and the badge appeal and exquisite handling of the Porsche Cayman or 911.","For over six decades the Chevrolet Corvette has attracted driving enthusiasts and automotive admirers alike with its power, performance and style, all at a price that, with some effort, can turn a dream into a reality. The 2017 Corvette coupe and convertible remain all those things and more. Reborn and reinvigorated three years ago for its seventh generation, the Corvette proudly waves the flag as America's premium sports car. That it can compete with Porsches and Aston Martins itself is impressive. More so is the price at which it does. For around $56,000, the Corvette is the rare performance car that's a value. Top-line Z06 performance models supercharge that manifesto with 650 horsepower, while the new Grand Sport highlights even sharper handling than the standard Stingray.","Spend even a brief amount of time in the 2017 Corvette Stingray and you might think this performance car costs $100,000 or more. Thankfully, this powerful coupe and convertible is...","Favorite Features 
 
GRAND SPORT
 Yes, the supercharged Z06's 650 horsepower is exhilarating, but the new Grand Sport is captivating in its own right. Impeccably balanced and offering grip for days, the 2017 Corvette GS brings serious track cred at a price that splits the difference between the standard Stingray and the Z06.
 
 CREATURE COMFORTS
 The Corvette took a much-needed leap forward in interior amenities with its latest generation. Climate-controlled seats, a robust infotainment system that is both CarPlay and Android Auto capable, and even in-car Wi-Fi are no longer the trappings of luxury-performance cars -- they can all be had on this high-performance Chevy.","","The big news for the 2017 Corvette is the Grand Sport edition. This racing-inspired Corvette features the wider body and performance enhancements of the supercharged Z06 but retains the Stingray's naturally aspirated V8. With the Z07 package, the Corvette Grand Sport is estimated to pull 1.2g in cornering capability.; The 7th-generation Corvette Stingray is strikingly fresh yet familiar: a long hood, low roof and glassed rear hatch, but all characteristics have been blessed and enhanced with modern flair. The headlights have been elongated, and deep creases run up the hood and sides all the way to the muscular rear haunches. Center-mounted quad exhaust outlets let the world know you mean business. Z06 and the new Grand Sport models are slightly longer and have a wider track and body than the standard Stingray. Convertible models offer a power-operated fabric roof that can be activated at speeds up to 30 mph.","The 2017 Corvette is available in three main versions -- Stingray, Grand Sport and Z06 as coupes or convertibles, in 1LT, 2LT and 3LT trims. Spend the least on a Corvette coupe and you'll still get a mean machine. There is, of course, that fire-breathing 6.2-liter V8 matched to a 7-speed manual transmission, 18-inch wheels in front/19 in rear, dual-zone climate control, 8-way-power seats, and power-adjustable steering wheel. The standard infotainment system includes a rearview camera, 9-speaker Bose audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability, a subscription-based 4G LTE system with built-in Wi-Fi and two years/24,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.","Optional Equipment 
We recommend the Z51 Performance Package for the Corvette Stingray, which upgrades the brakes, suspension, oiling system, tires and cooling system, while adding an electronic limited-slip differential and performance-exhaust system. Magnetic Ride Control lets the Corvette go from the freeway to a racetrack. If you take your Corvette to the track, check out the navigation system with data recorder, which has a windshield-mounted camera to record your laps in high-def video for later playback. Interior upgrades include suede trim, heated/ventilated seats, and upgraded audio system. The Z07 package for the GS and Z06 includes carbon-ceramic brakes, summer tires and magnetic suspension.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $56,445 for a coupe and $60,445 for a convertible. Grand Sport coupe and convertible models start $10,000 higher. The current top-dog is the Corvette Z06, at $81,390 for a coupe and $85,390 for a convertible. Options can add thousands or in the case of the C7.R Special Edition, more than $24,000. The Corvette competes with -- and undercuts -- such rivals as the Porsche 911, Dodge Viper, Audi R8, Mercedes-AMG GT and Jaguar F-Type. True, the Dodge aside, those rivals are luxury brands while Chevy is decidedly mainstream. But that the Corvette can match or best those cars' performance emphasizes the value of America's premium sports car. KBB.com Fair Purchase Price will tell you what others in your area are paying for their Corvette. Yet another benefit: The Corvette is expected to have great resale value.

If you crave serenity, seek comfort without excess, and strive to be at one with the world, we think the Volvo S90 will offer you special appeal.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Should your idea of luxury revolve around an ultra-prestigious nameplate that carries with it an aggressive statement of superiority over the masses, the Volvo S90 might not be your cup of aquavit.","The midsize luxury sedan segment is one of the most demanding in the world, chock-full of favorites that include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Audi A6 among a swarm of significant others. So with its all-new 2017 Volvo S90 sedan, the company has chosen to wade into a very deep area of the pool, but in true Scandinavian fashion the Swedish automaker has decided to approach the segment in a non-traditional manner. The new S90 goes heavy on quality-of-life aspects like interior aesthetics, infotainment and, of course, safety. What has emerged is a strikingly good-looking sedan that might well be the most complete semi-autonomous car now available.","Sitting as we are on the cusp of the autonomous driving revolution in one of the most sophisticated semi-autonomous vehicles in the world, driving impressions of the new S90 become...","Favorite Features 
 
GEN2 PILOT ASSIST
 Volvo’s Pilot Assist is, Volvo admits, a stepping-stone technology on the way to fully autonomous cars, but it doesn’t pretend to be an autopilot. Volvo is adamant about the driver’s responsibility for the safety of the car. The technology keeps the S90 in its lane as long as it is engaged and the driver has her or his hands on the steering wheel, and it functions not only in low-speed bumper-to-bumper traffic situations, but also in general over-the-road highway driving.
 
 SCANDINAVIAN SANCTUARY
 We don’t mean to get all “rocks-and-trees” on you, but the designers’ goal of creating a “Scandinavian Sanctuary” within the 2017 Volvo S90 is realized in the car. In addition to its lovingly crafted interior it offers a state-of-the-art infotainment system that features advanced Apple CarPlay integration and the availability of a 19-speaker Bowers & Wilkins system that sounds like the Gothenburg concert hall.","Some luxury carmakers telegraph their models’ luxury credentials with heavy-handed boldness, but Volvo’s designers took a different path with the S90 sedan. For instance, a single piece of shaped walnut adorns the passenger side of the dash. The instruments and controls are gathered in easy-to-understand pods that offer a simple grace. The functional design of the Sensus control interface adds to the driver’s ease, and the new-gen seats prove yet again that Volvo is a world leader in vehicle seat comfort and function. After hours at the wheels of various S90s over the course of our testing we emerged fresh and ready for more driving. Volvo designers haven’t forgotten about rear seat comfort either, delivering ample legroom and commodious width.","If up to now we haven’t mentioned that the S90 is a handsome car, in person there is no doubt of it. Because the S90 was newly designed from the ground up, designers and engineers were able to build in an attractive axle-to-cowl ratio with wheels at the four corners and the accompanying short overhangs. The body is a highly intelligent patchwork of different grades of steel, engineered to protect the occupants while at the same time pleasing their eyes. Special features include the front grille that is scalloped in homage to the Volvo P1800 sports car, the “Thor’s hammer” motif in the LED headlights and a sweeping line that extends from bow to stern inspired by the sailboats of Sweden’s incomparable West Coast.","Driver assist and safety systems lead the discussion of the Volvo S90’s most notable standard items. In addition to the previously mentioned Gen2 Pilot Assist system, the new S90 offers “Run-off Road Mitigation” that is designed to prevent one of the most common types of fatal accidents. Between speeds of 40-85 mph the system can sense a potential run-off-the-road situation, and in response it can both steer and brake automatically to keep the S90 on the road. Although potentially intrusive, the system can be overridden by overt driver action. It is designed to function in times of driver inattention and/or impairment that could send the car careening off the road. Other standard niceties include Volvo’s justifiably famous City Safety collision-avoidance system and LED headlights.","Optional Equipment 
As one climbs the trim level ladder the new S90 goes from very good to even better. The “Momentum” features Apple CarPlay and USB, the vision package adds cross-traffic alert, a 360-degree camera system, park-assist pilot, front-park assist, and a power-operated trunk lid. The “Inscription” trim brings with it road-following lights that turn in response to your steering inputs, a matte silver grille, additional chrome adornments, perforated leather seats, a leather-covered instrument panel, plus walnut inlays. All-wheel drive is available in both trim levels, and the rear air suspension system is available as a standalone option.","Under the Hood 
 
Using a clean-sheet-of-paper approach to powertrains, Volvo has committed to an inline 4-cylinder engine as its basic building block. From there, it adds increasingly high levels of sophistication on the continuum from the 250-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the T5 version, to the 316-horsepower direct-injected, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the T6. Both engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission to send power to the front (T5) or all four (T6) wheels. The upcoming “Twin-Engine” T8 doesn’t precisely add a second engine but instead an electric motor in a plug-in hybrid configuration similar to that of the XC90 plugin.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4
 250 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500 rpm

As one of the globe’s smallest car companies, Volvo is trying to change the world. Its Vision 2020 goal is to ensure that no one be killed or injured in a new Volvo in the year 2020 and beyond. While it is hard to put a price tag on such a goal, it is not hard to applaud. For the 2017 Volvo S90 T5 Momentum sedan, the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price starts just under $48,000, with an optioned-up T6 Inscription reaching over $67,000. Since the S90 is so new to the market as this is being written figures are not in on a 5-year cost-to-own calculation, but we expect the car to fall mid-pack in this prestige-driven segment. For a glimpse at real-world transaction prices, we suggest you look at the KBB Fair Purchase Price for the S90 when it becomes available. We think it is a luxury sedan that could surprise you.

If style and flair mean more to you than driving the fastest car to lap the Nurburgring, the 2017 Maserati Ghibli will come as a breath of fresh air. With plenty of performance on hand, we doubt anyone driving a competing BMW, Audi or Lexus will look down upon your car.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If performance and refinement are your first priorities any number of better-established models, such as the Audi S7, Cadillac CTS-V or BMW M5, are superior to the Ghibli. They also come with better repair and reliability histories and a larger dealer network.","In a world of reserved luxury sedans, the 2017 Maserati Ghibli stands head and shoulders above the rest. Why? It starts with the Ghibli’s exotic Italian styling and sumptuous interior. To that, the Italian masters add a hefty helping of Maserati power, performance and handling, then bring the best 21st-century technologies into the cabin to create a luxury exotic unlike anything from Audi, BMW or Lexus. The 2017 Ghibli, Ghibli S and Ghibli S Q4 are all powered by a twin-turbocharged V6 making 345 horsepower in the base and S trims, and 404 in the all-wheel-drive (AWD) Q4.

ALUMINUM STRUCTURE
 Thanks to an extensive use of aluminum, Maserati’s Ghibli sports sedan for 2017 keeps its weight right around two tons. Despite the lighter weight, the Ghibli’s structure remains appropriately stiff, which helps improve handling as well as cut down on interior rattles.
 
 EXTERIOR DESIGN
 Let’s face it. The first thing that catches our eye when car shopping isn’t the EPA figures or crash-test scores; it’s the design. Maserati’s Ghibli sedan for 2017 is simply stunning from any angle. In a sea of conservative German and American design, it truly shines.","","New for the 2017 Ghibli sedan is the addition of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The Ghibli’s dash has been revised to accommodate a new 8.4-inch touch screen, and a console-mounted rotary knob is added for those who despise using touch screens. Two new packages are offered: Sport and Luxury.; It’s not just the sculpted exterior that sets the 2017 Ghibli apart from the rest of the parking lot; it can be personalized in a multitude of ways. There are about a dozen color selections, color choices for the brake calipers, and numerous wheel and tire options. All that only embellishes the Ghibli’s nearly living, breathing shape. Up front is a familiar Maserati grille, with the trident displayed prominently; bearing close family resemblance to the larger Quattroporte, the theme somehow seems more fitting on the Ghibli’s smaller structure. From Fiats to Ferraris, the Italians have seldom done un-handsome cars.","We’re talking about a midsize-luxury-sports sedan with an exotic heritage, so the Maserati Ghibli is expectedly well-equipped. Standard fare includes a power sunroof, Italian-leather upholstery, heated and 8-way-power front seats, navigation, dual-zone climate control, keyless entry and starting system, Start & Stop, Blind Spot and Cross Path alert, power trunklid with hands-free operation, and all the usual and expected driving aids and occupant-protection features. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay join a new 8.4-inch touch-screen infotainment system backed by a 900-watt, 10-speaker harman/kardon audio system.","Optional Equipment 
Maserati offers the 2017 Ghibli with an immense array of personalization choices, with multiple exterior colors, leather interiors, wheel selections and even different colors for brake calipers. A new Sport Package adds 20-inch alloy wheels, red brake calipers, Skyhook Adaptive Suspension, 12-way-power sport seats and a sport steering wheel. The Luxury Package brings 19-inch alloy wheels, black brake calipers, Zegna Edition Silk or full leather interior and 12-way-power comfort seats with memory function. There’s also a Bowers & Wilkins Premium Surround system with Clari-Fi, which scans digital music and restores the details lost from digital compression.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Maserati Ghibli starts just shy of $73,000 and the S model just shy of $78,500. The AWD Ghibli S Q4 is near $81,000; that’s our purchase recommendation, because it has all-wheel drive and more power for not a lot more money. Add options, and the total can reach $100,000 or more. By comparison, some of the major competitors (BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6) can be much lower before adding on the extras. Furthermore, the higher potential price of the Ghibli is not helped by Maserati’s record of not holding onto residual values nearly as well as the competitors.

 Acura’s technological prowess is on full display with the industry’s first 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that includes a torque converter. Available only on the 4-cylinder TLX, this transmission delivers smooth, quick shifts while maximizing fuel economy and performance.
 
 SUPER HANDLING All-WHEEL DRIVE
 SH-AWD is more than just a sure-footed system to improve traction; it is a torque-vectoring setup that constantly routes torque to all four wheels. Not only is power routed to the front and rear wheels, but left and right as well, improving both steering input and stability.","Historically, Acura interiors are precisely tailored, closely detailed and intuitively user-friendly, and the 2017 TLX sedan maintains that appreciated tradition. In the center stack an 8-inch information screen is positioned where it’s easy to see; below that, a 7-inch touch screen is where it’s easy to operate. There are switches for the climate control, and a big knob allows scrolling through the sound system or navigation. The 4-cylinder models have a conventional shift lever while the V6 versions shift with buttons. Seats are comfy and supportive both front and rear, and soft-touch materials and well-done wood and aluminum accents finish the detailing.","Acura’s 2017 TLX performance-luxury sedan might not stand out in a crowd but it is an elegant and handsome piece of work. In front is the satin-finished proboscis that’s become the face of Acura, flanked by detailed LED headlights. Flowing lines along the sides wrap into a nice conjunction of taillights and decklid. Visual differentiations between the 4-cylinder and V6 models are the latter’s optional fog lights and a small badge on the rear of SH-AWD models. Not on the cutting edge of design, the TLX also won’t go out of style in the next 13 minutes, and we like it.","In addition to the first use of LED headlights as standard equipment across the board, the well-equipped Acura TLX for 2017 has a high level of standard features including keyless entry and start, heated power front seats, rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, power moonroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, high-gloss Zebra wood accents, tilt/telescope steering column, 355-watt 7-speaker sound system, 60/40-split folding rear seats, one-touch power windows, Bluetooth connectivity, electronic cruise control and automatic headlights.","Optional Equipment 
There are two major option packages from which to choose. The Technology Package (about $4,000) includes navigation with real-time traffic, an upgraded 490-watt 10-speaker Acura/ELS Studio sound system with hard-disk drive, forward-collision warning, lane-keeping assist, lane-departure warning, blind-spot information, rear cross-traffic monitor, leather-trimmed interior, rain-sensing wipers and a frameless rearview mirror. The Advance Package (a little over $3,000), available only on V6 models, includes collision-mitigation braking with head-up warning, adaptive cruise control with low-speed following, road-departure mitigation and heated/ventilated front seats. These packages are not inexpensive but we feel they deliver a lot of value for the money.","Under the Hood 
 
Acura’s 2017 TLX is available with a choice of three distinct drivetrains: a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder front-wheel drive (FWD) with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and a 3.5-liter V6 with a 9-speed automatic and either FWD or all-wheel drive (AWD). The 4-cylinder model feels light on its feet and has ample power for a car in this class. The V6 is even more muscular without a huge fuel-economy penalty and benefits from advanced gas-saving technologies such as cylinder deactivation and idle stop/start. The 4-cylinder offers plenty of performance and the V6 returns commendable fuel economy, so it’s a close call but, everything considered, unless you really need all-wheel drive to deal with bad weather, for most people we’d recommend the 4-cylinder version.

 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Acura TLX has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a little under $33,000 for the base 4-cylinder model; the front-drive V6 is just a few hundred dollars over $36,000 and fully loaded will be around $43,500; and the V6 SH-AWD is around $42,500 and will be over $45,500 with the Advance Package. In its class, TLX prices are comparable to the Lexus IS, which runs in the low-$40,000 range, and the Audi A4. To get a better idea of what people are paying for the 2017 Acura TLX in your area, check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. As for resale, we expect the TLX to hold strong 5-year residual values, better than the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Infiniti Q50, but just shy of the Lexus ES 350.

If you’re seeking perfection in performance, image and luxury, you’ll find BMW’s new 5 Series is on a similar quest. From the fuel-efficient diesel and 4-cylinder turbo to the fire-breathing M5, there is a 5 Series sedan to please just about every desire.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If there is one thing BMW doesn’t do well, it’s soft. If you’re seeking a comfortable ride and lavish interior, we suggest going with an Audi or a Lexus sedan. Those who find the BMW name isn’t worth the steep price might enjoy a Hyundai Genesis, Chrysler 300 or Acura RLX.","The 2016 BMW 5 Series remains the benchmark sedan for the midsize luxury- performance market. Earning its performance credentials over many years, the 5 Series continues to grow both its model range and its fan base. With models ranging from a $51,000 4-cylinder turbo to a tire-smoking M5 costing twice as much, the 5 Series offers a dizzying number of choices. Need something with more versatility? There’s the 5-door Gran Turismo. Looking for power and fuel economy? Try a 5 Series diesel or hybrid trim. You can find similar levels of luxury in a Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 or Lexus GS, but not the same performance. Conversely, the Cadillac CTS-V can challenge the M5 at the track, but not quite yet at the country club.","Regardless if you want a rear-drive or all-wheel-drive 5 Series (dubbed “xDrive” by BMW), you’ll end up with one of the best driving, best handling sedans available.

DIESEL ENGINE
 Soot-free, quiet and sophisticated, today’s diesel engines have come a long way. In the 2016 BMW 535d sedan, the diesel engine delivers gobs of torque, great fuel economy and less maintenance.
 
 M SPORT PACKAGE
 Designed with the driver in mind, BMW’s M Sport Package beefs up the factory 5 Series with lightweight 18-inch alloy wheels, a sport suspension and an increase in the limited top speed.","","Changes for the 2016 BMW 5 Series are modest. A power tailgate and harman/kardon Surround Sound audio system are now standard on the 550i, while all models receive enhanced USB and Bluetooth.; The 2016 BMW 5 Series sedan's design announces the car's athleticism without chasing fads. Up front is the requisite twin-kidney grille, the sides are crisply creased, and the rear features a nicely tapered trunk and contoured LED light strips. M5 models are identified by their quad-exhaust outlets. While the 5 Series sedan is anything but controversial, the same cannot be said about the somewhat bloated 5 Series Gran Turismo. Despite its awkward rear, the tailgate sports a dual-access design that allows you to open a smaller trunklid or the entire hatch to load larger items.","Even a base BMW 528i is well-equipped, as should be expected in a $51,000 sedan. Highlights include a standard navigation system, moonroof, bright xenon headlights, automatic climate control, a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD system with HD Radio reception, and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with all-season run-flat tires. Surprisingly, leather is still an option on base models, which use leather-like upholstery. Go one trim higher with the 535i and you get the real thing. Also extra is a rearview camera, something becoming standard on cars from mainstream brands. New BMWs include Ultimate Service, which includes four years/50,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.","Optional Equipment 
As with all BMWs, the 2016 5 Series offers a lengthy options list both in package and stand-alone form. As daunting – and expensive – as this may be, one nice aspect is that most features are available across the line. That means you don't have to step up trims to have the 20-way climate-controlled front seats with massage function, hands-free trunk opener, full LED lights, Bang & Olufsen audiophile system, rear-seat entertainment screens, or a package that bundles features like lane-departure warning, active cruise control and a bird's-eye-view camera system. And we haven't even mentioned performance upgrades.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 BMW 5 Series has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $51,000 for a base 528i. Prices increase by several thousand dollars as you climb trims, with a 535i starting over $56,500 and a 550i debuting beyond $67,000. The sizzling M5 begins around $96,000. The 5 Series Gran Turismo variants start just shy of $62,000. And keep in mind, these prices are before options. Competitors such as the Mercedes E-Class, Infiniti Q70, Jaguar XF and Lexus GS all share the 5 Series' roughly $50,000 starting price, while the Audi A6, Cadillac CTS and Acura TLX start several thousand less. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The BMW 5 Series' resale value is expected to be in line with competitors like the E-Class, except for the ActiveHybrid 5 and Gran Turismo models, which have poor residual value.

Searching high and low for an exclusive luxury sedan that can run like the wind? The 2017 Porsche Panamera is like driving a 4-door 911, only better. The Panamera has a real back seat that can comfortably fit two adults, plus a nearly inexhaustible list of available technology and luxury features.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Despite its ground-up reincarnation, the distinctive Panamera silhouette is still present. If you were not a fan of the original, the 2017 Porsche Panamera probably won’t change your mind. Those needing ample rear-seat headroom and a secure trunk should look to the Audi RS 7 or Mercedes-Benz AMG S65.","When Porsche first introduced the 4-door Panamera, a lot of Porsche purists were put off. The design was awkward and the handling was nowhere near that of other Porsche cars. Fast-forward to the all-new 2017 Porsche Panamera, and you’ll find a re-boot with crisper styling, better performance and all the right bits to create a 4-door Porsche even the most stubborn enthusiast would be proud to own. Easily the equal of the BMW M6 Gran Coupe and Audi RS 7, the new Panamera makes the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Maserati Quattroporte feel a bit outdated. With power ranging from 440 to 550 horsepower, Porsche’s Panamera 4S and Turbo for 2017 promise impressive performance with an equally impressive suspension, steering and brake setup to match.","Where the previous Panamera demonstrated good performance, ride and handling characteristics, the new 2017 Panamera Turbo makes the old car seem like a relic.

BURMESTER AUDIO
 Developed exclusively for Porsche, the Burmester 3D High End Surround Sound system is one of the best we’ve experienced. Two efficient amplifiers power 21 speakers, and control over the music can be achieved via multiple settings in the touch-screen controller. There’s even an option to focus the sound to a particular seat.
 
 4D CHASSIS CONTROL
 By monitoring the driving situation in all three spatial dimensions, Porsche’s 4D Chassis Control System is able to synchronize the many electronic suspension and chassis systems to deliver the optimal blend of ride comfort and performance.","","Porsche’s 2017 Panamera performance sedan is all-new from the ground up. The styling is crisper, as are the car’s steering, braking and cornering abilities.; Porsche’s Panamera sports sedan for 2017 shares not a single panel with the outgoing model, yet it is immediately recognizable. The hood and front fascia are squared up a bit, with stronger character lines to make the Panamera a bit more menacing. The familiar curved hatchback rear end is still in place, but the rear fenders are wider, as is the car itself. The 2017 Panamera is only about an inch longer than the 2016 car, but it looks bigger and more substantial. Familiar features like the LED headlights are here, as are new toys such as the 4-position adaptive rear spoiler.","For the price, one would expect the 2017 Porsche Panamera 4S to come well equipped, and one would be correct. There’s a panoramic glass moonroof plus front and rear parking sensors, 19-inch wheels, 8-way-power adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation and a 10-speaker premium audio system. The Turbo model adds LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, 14-speaker Bose audio, full leather interior, power-adjustable steering column, Alcantara roof lining, 14-way-power front seats and heated rear seats. Performance equipment includes Porsche Stability Management System (PSM) and the integrated 4D Chassis Control unit.","Optional Equipment 
The list of possible option combinations is nearly limitless. Among the more notable upgrades are a 21-speaker Burmester audio system, rear-seat center-console touch screen, adaptive cruise control, adaptive LED headlights, Sport Package (air suspension, Sport Chrono package, rear-axle steering and sport exhaust), ceramic composite brakes, a heated steering wheel, 18-way-adaptive sport seats, ventilated front and rear seats, infrared night-vision camera, Lane Change Assist, Lane Keep Assist, massaging seats and 4-zone automatic climate control with separate air-temperature, blower-intensity and air-distribution adjustments for each seat. Porsche will also customize the Panamera’s interior to any color you like.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Porsche Panamera 4S 4-door performance sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $101,000, including destination charges. The Panamera Turbo pushes the price closer to $148,000. Adding numerous option packages and add-ons can push the price well past the $200,000 mark. An Audi S7 or BMW 6 Series Gran Sport start about $20,000 less than the Panamera 4S, while the Turbo’s pricing is well above the starting price for the Audi RS 7, BMW M6 Gran Sport and Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG 4Matic. On the flip side, an Aston Martin Rapide S starts around $200,000 and goes up from there. Check KBB's Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their 2017 Porsche Panamera, and note that residual values are lower than Lexus, about the same as BMW, Audi and Mercedes, and much better than Jaguar.

Love the look and feel of a wagon but not the stigma or limited availability? The 2016 GLA compact-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz is the perfect solution. Available all-wheel drive makes the GLA the perfect year-round companion, while the AMG version should satisfy the most demanding enthusiast.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want a sporty-looking compact-luxury SUV, but you also need the ability to go off-road and carry lots of cargo and people, a Land Rover Evoque, BMW X3 or even a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk makes a better choice.","With compact-luxury crossover SUVs like the BMW X1 and Lexus NX roaming freely, it was only a matter of time before Mercedes-Benz jumped into the fray. With the 2016 GLA, MB has produced a sub-$35,000 compact-luxury crossover SUV that obliterates the field with its stunning good looks, powerful engine options and surprisingly roomy interior. Sharing its engines and underpinnings with the popular CLA sedan, the GLA250 and GLA45 AMG depart from the Audi A3, Land Rover Evoque and BMW X1 by creating a silhouette more wagon-like than SUV. As such, the GLA appeals more to driving enthusiasts with light off-road needs rather than the “outdoor lifestyle” crowd so over-represented in most marketing campaigns.","Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA250 luxury-crossover SUV is the kind of vehicle that prompts fights over who gets the driver’s seat and who rides shotgun, and there’s even more to love when...","Favorite Features 
 
DOWNHILL SPEED REGULATION 
Although you probably won’t be taking the 2016 MB GLA250 to the Rubicon Trail, the standard Hill Descent Control is a nice feature to have when creeping down a snow-covered hill or the occasional dirt trail. 
 
PANORAMA SUNROOF 
A panoramic sunroof can help open an otherwise claustrophobic cabin, but when fitted to a vehicle the size of Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA compact-luxury SUV, it practically makes one feel like they’re driving a convertible.","Though the 2016 GLA luxury-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz feels somewhat coupe-like from the front seats (which is no accident – after all, it’s essentially based on the so-called 4-door- coupe format of the CLA), rear passengers are met with more generous headroom thanks to the GLA’s 3.5-inch-taller SUV profile. As such, this bubble-like greenhouse is bestowed with poplar, burled-walnut or aluminum trim options, which make it feel rather upscale in spite of its accessible price point. Those who won’t spring for leather will get the faux – but convincing – MB-Tex upholstery instead.","You can tell a lot about a car by its available colors, and the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250’s available palette suggests a level of sophistication and maturity that you simply can’t find in other accessible offerings. Early adopters can choose the Edition Orange, of which 750 will be built, as well as a limited Night Package that adds gloss-black trim and black wheels. AMG versions receive the obligatory aggressive body treatment, while an optional Aerodynamics Package goes to 11 with a larger front splitter and a big roof spoiler.","The GLA250 comes with an impressive list of safety items, including collision prevention with autonomous braking and attention assist. Other unexpected standard items include an off-road mode with hill-descent control and a graphical representation of suspension and steering settings with 4Matic versions. Engine stop/start, keyless start and a power liftgate round out the list of off-the-shelf items you might not expect in a reasonably priced Mercedes-Benz.","Optional Equipment 
If you’re smitten with the AMG model’s looks but are stuck with a standard-sized budget, the Sport Package adds meaner bodywork and 19-inch, 5-spoke AMG wheels. Available convenience items include blind-spot assistance, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, and park assist, which helps find a parking spot and takes the reins by steering the GLA into the open space.","Under the Hood 
 
Both of the 2016 GLA’s engine offerings are mated to 7-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The lineup’s powerplants couldn’t be more different in terms of spec, however – the GLA250’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the GLA45 AMG’s yields 355 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque (as well as a more aggressively programmed transmission). The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV is available in front- or in all-wheel-drive 4Matic trim (FWD, AWD).

In front-drive form, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV starts just under $33,500, with the AWD version about $2,000 above that. At that mark, the GLA represents a solid value considering its quality interior and generous standard equipment. If you don’t mind keeping it somewhat simple by forgoing expensive options, you should be able to purchase a new GLA for less than you might think. The AMG version commands around $50,000, but the sportier model also delivers a fiercer, more mature driving experience. To get a good idea of what others are paying in your area, be sure to check out our Fair Purchase Price. Value should also work in the new GLA’s favor, as Mercedes vehicles tend to hold their value more than most, better than the Lincoln MKC, Audi Q3, Lexus NX and BMW X1, but on par with Land Rover Evoque.

If the idea of a Volkswagen GTI in SUV form gets your blood running, check out the Tiguan. Like that performance hatchback, the Tiguan has a turbo engine and dynamic handling, but adds a taller ride height and VW's available 4Motion all-wheel drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
While the Tiguan has sporty driving manners, it's a step behind rivals in terms of fuel economy and the latest safety and driving aids like automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and active cruise control. The Tiguan is also smaller than its rivals and at nearly $26,000 has a higher starting price.","The 2017 Tiguan is Volkswagen's small crossover SUV, the little brother to the also-uniquely-named Touareg. Like its sibling, the VW Tiguan is an outlier among better-known crossover SUVs, in this case the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue. The Tiguan aims and even succeeds somewhat in bringing European flair and athletic manners to a segment often focused on low-priced practicality. But the Tiguan's German character and standard 200-horsepower turbocharged engine don't come cheap. The Tiguan is among the smallest in its class, which makes it a snap to park but also means less cargo space. Despite its higher pricing and lack of the latest safety tech, the Tiguan is attractive for those seeking a small SUV with an athletic, premium character.","With a 200-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and athletic dynamics, there's merit to VW's claim that the Tiguan is the GTI of the compact-SUV class. However, it's still taller and heavier...","Favorite Features 
 
EUROPEAN STYLE
 The Volkswagen Tiguan has been around in its current form for several years, yet it still looks fresh and handsome thanks to its Euro style. The minimalist design is obviously Volkswagen even without the ""VW"" logo on the nose, and the same is true for the comfortable and upscale-feeling interior.
 
 FLEXIBLE INTERIOR
 Speaking of that interior, Volkswagen makes do with its relatively limited space with clever packaging. The rear seats fold in a 3-way 40/20/40 split, and the Tiguan's rear seat slides six inches to accommodate cargo or people.","","The aging Tiguan gets yet another lineup shuffle, with the R-Line and SE trims gone and Wolfsburg and Sport trims arriving. Base S models now come with a 6.3-inch infotainment system. An all-new, larger 3-row Tiguan is set to arrive in 2017.; With an overall length just over 174 inches, Volkswagen's Tiguan is small even by compact-SUV standards. The Honda CR-V, for example, is about five inches longer, while the Nissan Rogue is a relative giant at nearly eight inches longer than the VW. The Tiguan's smooth, uncluttered lines and horizontal grille give it a squat appearance. Although it bears a familial resemblance to its Touareg bigger brother, the Tiguan's small size and lower ground clearance make it appear more cute than tough. Standard roof rails help with the latter, though, and add to this small SUV's gear-carrying functionality.","The Tiguan's trim choices are S, Wolfsburg, Sport and SEL. The least expensive S starts just under $26,000 and includes keyless access with push-button start, V-Tex faux-leather upholstery with heated front seats, rearview camera, and 6.3-inch touch-screen infotainment system with AM/FM/CD/HD Radio and USB and SD card readers. Wolfsburg leaps in price to nearly $31,000 and includes panoramic moonroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, power front seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility via VW's Car-Net smartphone app functionality. Here we'd usually recommend a trim as the best value, but at these prices it's hard to justify the Tiguan in light of better-equipped, lower-priced rivals.","Optional Equipment 
Aside from 4Motion AWD, most extras for the 2017 Tiguan come by climbing trims. Keep doing that with the Sport version and you'll get aesthetically unique exterior accents, leather seating, a sport suspension for better handling, bi-xenon headlights and LED daytime running lights, driver's-seat memory position, navigation system and dual-zone climate control. Top-line Tiguan SEL models also have the sport suspension, plus premium audio system, snazzy power-folding side mirrors and 19-inch wheels. At over $35,000 for this top model, you can get a much better value with either a base Tiguan or by looking at a different compact SUV.","Pricing Notes 
 
VW lowered the entry price of the Tiguan a couple of years ago, but it's still hard to call it a good value. A base Tiguan S carries a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $25,860. Adding AWD is another $1,975. The Wolfsburg starts just under $31,000, and a loaded SEL will set you back over $37,000. That kind of money can buy a lot more vehicle if you look to one of the VW's many competitors. Rivals offer more advanced safety features like blind-spot monitoring and autonomous braking, amenities like power liftgates and heated rear seats, and even more power. If the Tiguan is still the SUV that tugs your heart, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for it. The VW Tiguan's resale value is expected to continue to trail leaders like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester.

Lincoln’s MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV for 2017 delivers the kind of styling, performance and amenities that allow it to compete head-on with the best European and Japanese brands. Although pricing can get high on top trims, mid-level models remain very competitive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for something with a large cargo bay and roomy rear seat, a larger vehicle like the Lincoln MKX or Lexus RX may be a better choice. For the price of a fully optioned MKC, buyers could be looking at an entry-level Porsche Macan or Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG.","Lincoln’s 2017 MKC compact-luxury SUV may be the company’s best effort to date. Although it shares a common architecture with the Ford Escape, the MKC shares little else. With its own distinct styling, interior and amenities, the 2017 Lincoln MKC exudes a youthful and cool vibe, something that has eluded Lincoln vehicles of late and is a welcome change. The 2017 Lincoln MKC small-luxury-crossover SUV has a rather substantial feel, placing it in the same league as the Audi Q3, Mercedes-Benz GLA and BMW X1. With a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, the MKC offers more choice than the Acura RDX and Land Rover Evoque, and even the new Cadillac XT5, which offers only a single V6.","Regardless of which EcoBoost engine is under the hood, the 2017 Lincoln MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV exudes a feeling of solidity, confidence and safety.

CONTINUOUSLY CONTROLLED DAMPING SUSPENSION
 Standard on AWD models and optional on all others, Lincoln’s CCD joins forces with Lincoln Drive Control allowing the driver to choose three distinct shock settings. Choices include the soft-riding Comfort, Normal (our favorite) and the rather firm Sport setting.
 
 ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL
 To ensure its MKC small-luxury-crossover SUV for 2017 remains true to Lincoln standards, the company employs advanced electronics to banish unwanted noise from the cabin. Active Noise Control creates noise-canceling sound waves via the car’s audio system, making it easier to use Bluetooth, as well as converse with passengers.","As the first vehicle from the new Lincoln Design Studio, the 2017 MKC’s well-finished cabin has a definite “class-above” character. Its dash-mounted push-button transmission controls yield additional storage space while the new Sync 3 system features user-friendly knobs and buttons instead of annoying slider controls. Up front, the MKC’s power bucket seats offer laudable comfort and support. However, its fixed-position 60/40-folding rear bench is less accommodating, particularly with respect to legroom for adults. Maximum cargo space -- expanding from 25.3 cubic feet to 53.1 with the seatbacks folded -- falls well below its larger Acura, Audi and BMW rivals.","Although aimed at younger and younger-thinking buyers, the MKC’s retains the old face of Lincoln, that being the split-wing grille framed by high-efficiency HID headlights. Full-width LED taillights grace a sophisticated wraparound rear hatch. The 2017 Lincoln MKC’s sleek profile is further enhanced by a flowing roofline, bold shoulder creases and smartly sculpted body panels. Standard across the lineup is a class-leading Approach Detection System that automatically illuminates the vehicle when its owner comes within eight feet and even includes color-keyed mini-lamps in each door pull. The Range-topping Reserve variant also features a huge 12-square-foot glass Vista Roof.","Every Lincoln MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV for 2017 comes dressed to impress. The entry-level Premiere model packs a bounty of power assists, active noise control and dual-zone climate control with Sync 3 and a 9-speaker audio system with SiriusXM radio. MKC Select spec replaces leather and aluminum cabin appointments with Bridge of Weir leather and premium wood, while adding ambient lighting, a 10-way-power passenger seat and auto-folding side-view mirrors. The MKC Reserve brings heated/cooled front seats, a glass panoramic Vista Roof, navigation, the MyLincoln Mobile app for always-on remote-vehicle access, blind-spot monitoring and a power-adjustability tilt/telescoping steering column.","Optional Equipment 
Buyers can personalize the MKC with a selection of free-standing extras as well as with focused equipment packages. Highlights include Continuously Controlled Damping, all-wheel drive, a 14-speaker THX II Certified Audio system, 19- and 20-inch wheel/tire fitments, and various paint finishes. All MKC’s offer the Climate Package (heated steering wheel/rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, automatic high-beam headlights), and a Class II Trailer Tow Package. The Select Plus Package bundles navigation with blind-spot monitoring, and the Reserve-only Technology Package brings adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and Forward Sensing and Active Park Assist systems. The Black Label series represents the ultimate Lincoln experience.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2017 Lincoln MKC compact-luxury SUV offers a choice of two turbocharged EcoBoost 4-cylinder engines. The base 2.0-liter is the same one used in the Ford Escape and produces an identical 240 horsepower/270 lb-ft of torque. Rated at 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque, the MKC’s optional engine is the same 2.3-liter used in the Ford Mustang. Both engines are backed by a 6-speed SelectShift automatic transmission that offers manual-style control via paddles mounted on the steering wheel. Although the engines boast very respectable fuel-economy figures, the MKC’s maximum tow rating -- when fitted with the optional Trailer Tow Package-- is 3,000 pounds, well under the Audi Q5’s class-leading 4,400-pound figure.

Lincoln offers the 2017 MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV with fairly aggressive pricing. A front-drive 2.0-liter MKC Premiere opens with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $33,600 -- nearly $3,000 less than the Acura RDX. An MKC Select pops that figure by nearly $3,000 with the MKC Black Label starting close to $46,500. Adding AWD bumps the bottom line on any 2.0-liter model by about $2,500. Pricing on the MKC Select AWD with the 2.3-liter engine starts around $40,000 and can top $56,000 on the fully equipped Black Label. Maxed-out SUV rivals from Audi, BMW and M-B can all top that figure by $5,000 or more, but they can also offer V6, turbodiesel and/or hybrid powertrain choices, enhanced towing capabilities, and stronger resale values.

For 2017 the Subaru Forester offers up an all-wheel-drive, fuel-efficient, 5-passenger compact SUV with a plethora of available safety equipment. It's also surprisingly good off-road and has an excellent reliability record. This year, it's even a little bit of a looker.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Despite the visual upgrades, the Forester still offers more practicality than pulchritude. And despite a turbo engine that makes the Forester genuinely quick, those looking for more zip should maybe check out options like the Ford Escape, which trades some practicality for pizazz.","The Subaru Forester's reputation wasn't formed on good looks, but on its solid reliability, practical nature and rugged utility. Sound nerdy? Maybe, but that tall greenhouse offers excellent visibility in all directions, and its roomy rear seat and cargo area are two features sometimes lacking in this class. However, the 2017 Subaru Forester has gone to finishing school. Sporting a new nose with LED-accented headlights, an upgraded and quieter interior, and luxurious interior trim packages, the 2017 Forester is shedding the pocket protector for a dash of style. Yet upgrades to the EyeSight driver-assist system, torque vectoring for the turbo model, and improved fuel economy are practical updates that will keep the Forester competitive against the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and many others.","The 2017 Subaru Forester is one of an increasingly rare breed that is equally adept on-road and off-road.

X-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROL
 The X-Mode button on the dash of Limited, Touring and XT models burnishes the Forester's off-road reputation. Press it, and the car will optimize control of the throttle, AWD, stability and traction control and Hill Descent Control to maximize the Forester’s low-speed on- and off-road potential.
 
 EYESIGHT DRIVER-ASSIST SYSTEM
 Improved this year, the available EyeSight system uses two color cameras to view the world ahead, allowing advanced safety features such as pre-collision braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and more.","","Turbocharged Forester models get a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system for better traction, while Forester models with the 2.5-liter engine and CVT get better fuel economy. The EyeSight driver-assist system gets more accurate color cameras, plus blind-spot monitoring is now available, and the interior is both more refined and quieter on the highway.; Subtle refinements to the exterior distinguish the 2017 Forester from its predecessor. The sleeker headlights incorporate","The base model Forester 2.5i comes standard with all-wheel drive, as well as features you'd expect in a modern car, such as power windows and door locks, air conditioning, cruise control, a multifunction steering wheel, Bluetooth, 6.2-inch Starlink touch-screen audio, variable wipers, 6-speed manual transmission, a rearview camera and color multifunction display. Move up to Premium and you get a panoramic sunroof and alloy wheels, while Limited models also get leather upholstery, automatic climate control and a power liftgate. Touring models get the new interior, plus a heated steering wheel, keyless ignition, an audio upgrade and dual-zone climate control.","Optional Equipment 
The CVT is optional on base and Premium models, and from Premium and above you can get the EyeSight driver-assist system, which now includes blind-spot detection and rear cross-path warning. Limited and above can be equipped with the navigation system. Premium models can now be ordered with the power liftgate as well. Touring models come very nicely equipped, with pretty much everything except the navigation system and EyeSight. Then there are the turbocharged XT models, which come in Premium and Touring models. About the only difference is that XT Premium models are available with the navigation system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2017 Subaru Forester 2.5i with the manual transmission is just under $23,500 including the $875 destination fee. The CVT automatic adds $1,000. The top-level Touring model with the non-turbo engine rings in at just over $30,000, not including any options. Want the turbo? A 2.0XT Premium -- the least expensive version -- starts at about $30,200, while the Touring version is about $35,200. Options add up, but not tremendously, and even a fully loaded 2.0XT Touring will stay less than $37,000. That all compares nicely with the rest of the class, including the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai Santa Fe and Chevrolet Equinox. Less expensive alternatives include the Mazda CX-5, no slouch itself. Check our Fair Purchase Price to see what folks in your area paid for the Forester. Resale value for the Forester is predicted to be better than most rivals.

If you want a small SUV with high style, an excellent warranty and the latest safety features like automatic emergency braking, put the Kia Sportage on your shopping list. Available features like climate-controlled seats, harman/kardon audio system and turbocharged engine can make this mainstream SUV feel like a premium one.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Sportage is neither the most fuel-efficient nor most spacious compact crossover SUV. The Honda CR-V tops it in both. If you need a smaller SUV with three rows of seating, try the Mitsubishi Outlander or the Kia Sorento. If efficiency is most important, wait for the forthcoming Kia Niro hybrid.","All-new for 2017, the Kia Sportage compact SUV is sharply dressed inside and out, boasts loads of technology, safety and comfort amenities, and continues to offer one of the best warranties in the business. As a rival to best-selling crossover SUVs such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape, the Kia Sportage more than holds its own. Introduced over two decades ago, the Sportage is Kia's long-running nameplate, but this new, 4th-generation model is further proof of Kia’s setting the pace or at least keeping right on top of it in a competitive segment. The Sportage touts good value, great looks and a strong roster of available features, but trails others in fuel economy, especially when outfitted with the uplevel turbocharged engine.","With both powerplants and the standard automatic transmission being carried over from the previous generation, the new Sportage's road manners aren't drastically different. The 2017 Sportage compact crossover SUV is...","Favorite Features 
 
KNOB, SWITCHES, OH MY!
 While other automakers have embraced finicky touch-based controls for audio, climate functions and the like, Kia has mercifully stuck with switches. Good-looking ones, too. Another thoughtful aspect: The switchgear and display screen are gently angled toward the driver to enhance visibility and reach.
 
 LUXURY AMENITIES, MAINSTREAM PRICE
 Not long ago, features like climate-controlled seats, heated steering wheel, a harman/kardon audio system and power tailgate were the stuff of luxury SUVs. Now all that and more is available on a mid-trim Kia Sportage. It all proves that you don't need to spend premium money to get premium amenities.","The Sportage's 2-row, 5-passenger interior is an enjoyable place to be, with a good driver’s seating position and improved outward visibility. The cabin’s thoughtful features include various storage compartments, and both a 12-volt power outlet and USB outlet for 2nd-row passengers. Also available is a huge panoramic sunroof. Rear-seat room is more than acceptable, and the seats recline for comfort and flexibility. Cargo space isn't as vast as that of a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, but at 30.7 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 60.1 with it down, it's still good. Even the rear floor can be positioned lower.","The Kia Sportage retains its athletic stance and sloping roof, but it's different enough from the outgoing model to draw interest. Most notable is the fresh front end, which features Kia's ""tiger-nose"" grille. Some of our editors immediately fell for the new design, while others preferred the bigger gape of the outgoing model. Kia says every body panel is new, and we especially like its sweeping rear taillights. SX Turbo models look the part with dual-exhaust outlets. All-wheel-drive (AWD) models have slightly more ground clearance than front-drive (FWD) versions and a unique front fascia for a steeper approach angle.","The 2017 Kia Sportage is available in three trims: LX, EX and SX Turbo. A base LX comes nicely equipped with a 5-inch touch-screen display and rearview camera, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, drive mode selector (Sport, Normal and Eco), and automatic headlights. We recommend the mid-trim Sportage EX, which includes Kia's newest UVO infotainment system with 7-inch capacitive touch screen, CarPlay and Android Auto phone connectivity, power-adjustable driver's seat, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, roof rails and solar-control glass to reduce heat buildup. All Sportage models come with Kia's excellent 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.","Optional Equipment 
All Sportage models are available with a Dynamax AWD that includes locking differential for improved traction on slick surfaces. In addition to the lineup's most powerful engine, the top-line SX Turbo model includes many features that are optional on the EX: navigation with 8-inch touch screen, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, automatic emergency braking, panoramic sunroof, power liftgate with programmable height adjustment and hands-free operation, heated and ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Ironically, the premium 320-watt harman/kardon sound system lacks a CD player, but its Clari-Fi technology improves the sound of digital music files.","Under the Hood 
 
Both 4-cylinder offerings in the 2017 Sportage are carried over from the last model, but each has been retuned for better fuel economy. They're both down in horsepower from the prior models -- just 1 for the standard 2.4-liter engine, a more significant 20 for the turbo 2.0-liter -- but each has more than enough gusto to get the job done. Fuel economy remains mid-pack, if that. At best, FWD models earn ratings of 23-mpg city/30 highway, while a turbo AWD Sportage gets a middling 20/23. All models come connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Kia Sportage can tow up to 2,000 pounds.
 
 2.4-liter inline-4
 181 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm

The 2017 Kia Sportage has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $23,885 for a base LX model. The more recommendable mid-trim EX starts at $26,395, and the top-line Sportage SX Turbo jumps to $33,395. Adding AWD to any model runs an additional $1,500. At these prices, the Sportage undercuts the market-leading CR-V, coming in a few hundred dollars to thousands less for comparable trims and/or features. For example, if you want a leather interior, the Sportage EX comes with it, but you'll have to spend $3,000 more to attain it on a Honda CR-V via the EX-L model. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Sportage. The Sportage's resale value has traditionally been mid-pack, trailing leaders like the CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester.

If you’re looking for a compact SUV that offers a broad range of drivetrains, trim levels and high-end options, the 2017 Jeep Cherokee compact-crossover SUV is unmatched in this segment and even bests some luxury brands.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Jeep’s 2017 Cherokee features some rather untraditional styling. It also has less interior room than a Hyundai Santa Fe Sport or Honda CR-V. Power from the 4-cylinder engine is a bit underwhelming, and Jeep’s long-term reliability and resale figures, while improving, still lag behind most Japanese competitors.","Although the 2017 Jeep Cherokee is sized and priced like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue, it is so much more than just a compact SUV with all-wheel-drive abilities. In fact, the Cherokee line is all-inclusive, running the gamut from basic transportation to rugged off-road-ready SUV. In between are a number of models, some showing a more sporting side to compete with the SUVs like the Mazda CX-5, while others offer luxury on par with the Lexus RX, Land Rover Evoque and BMW X3. Jeep’s Cherokee compact SUV suffers from some shortcomings, however, like its underpowered 4-cylinder engine and, on upper trims, a rather exorbitant price tag. An available V6 solves the power problem, plus provides an impressive 4,500-pound tow rating.","Jeep’s Cherokee compact SUV for 2017 comes in numerous flavors, including Sport, Latitude, Limited, Overland and Trailhawk. There are also several specialty trims. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard on all...","Favorite Features 
 
9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
 Designed by ZF, the 2017 Jeep Cherokee’s 9-speed automatic maximizes fuel economy while delivering good performance. Although earlier versions suffered from some lag issues, our version worked flawlessly and helped the Cherokee’s V6 deliver highway fuel economy worthy of a 4-cylinder.
 
 SELEC-TERRAIN
 You won’t find anything like this on a Honda CR-V or Subaru Forester. The Selec-Terrain system on the 2017 Cherokee uses the vehicle’s brakes, traction and stability control and engine-management system to deliver optimal grip on varying road conditions.","The 2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV interior blends traditional Jeep cues -- such as the trapezoidal ""center stack"" -- with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The seats offer good support and come trimmed in either attractive cloth or soft Nappa leather. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. We were particularly fond of the available wireless-device charging pad, plus the enormous glove box. However, we do wish the Cherokee offered more room overall.","""Polarizing"" is the best way to sum up the Jeep Cherokee for 2017. It's one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely. However, we've warmed up to the newest Jeep Cherokee, and there's a lot here that says “Jeep.” The 7-slot grille has a ""kink"" folding it into the hood, and the less controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the macho with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.","All Jeep Cherokee SUVs come standard with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, offering very good fuel economy and a range of about 500 miles on a tank of gasoline. Other standard equipment includes a Uconnect 5-inch touch-screen media center that includes Bluetooth, USB, SD and auxiliary ports. Also standard are a 3.5-inch full-color center display, 10 airbags, electronic stability control, traction control, Hill-start Assist, electric power steering, and an electric parking brake, plus cruise control, air conditioning with rear outlets, and remote keyless entry. The Jeep Cargo Management system includes standard hooks and a storage tote.","Optional Equipment 
Jeep Cherokee Sport, Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk models can get the 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine, which is standard on the Overland. There are three 4WD systems available as well: Active Drive I, Active Drive II and, on Trailhawk models, Active Drive Lock. Other upgrades include an 8.4-inch touch screen for Uconnect, a 9-speaker Alpine audio system and a CommandView dual-pane panoramic sunroof with power sunshade. Limited models offer leather, heated and ventilated power seats, a heated steering wheel, Keyless Enter-N-Go, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Trailhawk models emphasize off-road capabilities with skidplates, an increased ride height and a more rugged look.","Under the Hood 
 
The base engine for the 2017 Jeep Cherokee is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine offering 184 horsepower. However, unlike many of its competitors, Jeep offers a V6 engine in its small SUV as well: a 3.2-liter V6 with 271 horsepower, and the added ability to tow up to 4,500 pounds. Both engines offer good fuel economy. Both engines come with a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-drive or 4WD. Three different 4WD systems are available, ranging from the Jeep Active Drive I and Jeep Active Drive II, to the aggressive Jeep Active Drive Lock reserved for the off-road-ready Trailhawk. V6 models get a modest fuel-economy bump thanks to the standard start/stop mechanism.

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base 2017 Jeep Cherokee Sport starts around $24,500 for the FWD version. Midrange Cherokee Latitude and Altitude models start at about $26,500 and $25,500, respectively, while Limited models start at about $30,500. If you want the off-road-ready Cherokee Trailhawk, bring at least $32,000 with you, more if you decide on the Overland. The 4WD systems add between $2,000 and $3,000, while the V6 adds about $1,700. That's right in the heart of competitors like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Toyota RAV4, none of which offer a V6 engine. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase price to see what others paid in your area. Also note that the Cherokee's cost of ownership runs better than average, but its resale still lags behind most Japanese competitors.

If you're looking for a no-fuss compact SUV that has a sterling reputation for reliability, practicality and value, the 2017 Honda CR-V will fit your life like a glove. It also might surprise you with its roster of advanced safety systems, tech features and sheer interior space.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you prioritize sporty manners, a Mazda CX-5 or higher-end Ford Escape will better fit the bill. Need to tow more than 1,500 pounds? A V6 Jeep Cherokee's 4,500-pound rating will likely do the job. If you just don't like turbo engines, the only non-turbo CR-V is a base model with fewer bells and whistles.","The Honda CR-V has been totally revamped for 2017, further polishing a formula of practicality, efficiency, refinement and value that has made it the best-selling SUV over the past 20 years. Now in its fifth generation, Honda's 5-passenger compact crossover SUV arrives with a new turbocharged engine that earns up to 34 mpg, a slew of active-safety features like blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking, and a revamped interior that is both roomier and more functional. While not the best at every single thing, the new CR-V is the easiest SUV to recommend to the broadest spectrum of shoppers. In a segment that includes such stalwarts as the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue, the latest CR-V still manages to rise to the top.","The 2017 CR-V now offers two means of motivation -- the carryover 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that powers base LX models or the new 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder used in the rest of...","Favorite Features 
 
HONDA SENSING SAFETY SUITE
 The latest CR-V not only ups the ante on safety offerings, it expands their availability. Honda Sensing bundles potentially life-saving, accident-avoiding features such as collision-mitigation braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitoring (which replaces the LaneWatch system). The suite is standard on all CR-V trims EX and up.
 
 INTERIOR SPACE
 Honda has a knack for making big space inside even its small vehicles, and the new CR-V furthers that tradition. This SUV's marginal exterior growth magically multiplies its interior space. Cargo space behind the rear seat now approaches 40 cubic feet, or nearly 76 with seats folded. Rear legroom increases to a whopping 40.4 inches.","As noted above, the 2017 CR-V's 2-row, 5-passenger interior space has only improved -- an impressive feat given that the outgoing model was already among the most spacious in its class. In addition to its growth, this Honda SUV's space is easier to utilize. The 60/40-split rear seats fold with a simple pull of a lever, and the rear cargo area has a 2-tier setup in which the floor can be flat or set lower to keep objects secure. EX and above models have a pair of useful rear USB ports to keep mobile devices juiced. Up front is the CR-V's familiar and enviable seating position that is comfortable and provides a good view out.","Though still unmistakably a CR-V, the latest version of Honda's small SUV looks like it has hit the gym. It is slightly longer, wider and taller. Ground clearance has also increased, from 6.3 inches for front-wheel-drive (FWD) models and 6.7 inches for all-wheel-drive (AWD) versions to 7.8 and 8.2 inches, respectively. This is especially good news for CR-V owners who will contend with snow and other foul weather. To our eyes, the latest design is just what the CR-V needed, making it appear less bulbous in the rear, and more substantial and slightly tougher in general.","The 2017 Honda CR-V comes in four flavors: LX, EX, EX-L and Touring. The least-expensive Honda CR-V LX includes single-zone automatic climate control, backup camera, 6-way manual adjust driver's seat, cruise control, and a 4-speaker, 160-watt audio system with 5-inch color screen and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The LX is the only CR-V with the carryover 2.4-liter engine. Most buyers will (and should) opt for the EX, which includes the turbo engine, power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, moonroof, push-button start, heated front seats and 7-inch-display audio/infotainment system that's Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatible. Significantly, EX models include the Honda Sensing safety suite (see Favorite Features).","Optional Equipment 
Major options come by climbing trims. Step up to the EX-L and you gain leather seating, power tailgate, 4-way power-adjustable passenger seat, HomeLink universal garage door opener, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and 8-speaker audio system. Top-line Touring models add a hands-free tailgate, navigation (optional in EX-L models), LED headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, roof rails, dual chrome exhaust outlets, and a 330-watt/9-speaker premium audio system. All-wheel drive is optional on all trims of the 2017 CR-V.","Under the Hood 
 
You now have two engine choices in the CR-V, though both are tied to trim level. The well-regarded 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that powered the last-gen CR-V carries over, but only in LX models. All other CR-Vs get a new 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Both have nearly the same power output, but the turbo has a few more horsepower and earns higher fuel economy. Unlike some turbo engines, this one is happy drinking regular unleaded gasoline. Both engines are tied to a CVT automatic transmission that has a sport mode for added responsiveness. Front-wheel drive is the standard setup, with all-wheel drive optional on both. Both engines in the CR-V are rated to tow 1,500 pounds -- on the low end of the SUV spectrum.

Adding leather and the other features in the EX-L model will cost around $30,000, while a top-line CR-V Touring edition begins over $33,000. Adding all-wheel drive is an extra $1,300. At these prices, the new CR-V is nearly in step with its archrival the Toyota RAV4, yet still manages to undercut it slightly. Others in this hot segment, such as the Nissan Rogue and Ford Escape, start slightly lower. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. Another aspect the CR-V has going for it is high resale value. It has traditionally held its value very well, and we expect the same of this new model.

If you’re the type who wants worry-free car care in a common-sense design, the 2017 Toyota RAV4 delivers both in spades. With trims ranging from basic to luxurious, the RAV4 offers everything compact-crossover-SUV shoppers need in an attractive package at an attractive price.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need your compact SUV to go off-road, be really fast or tow a trailer, you might be better off with a Subaru Forester XT or Jeep Cherokee V6. The Mazda CX-5 offers better handling than the RAV4, while the Nissan Rogue offers the option of a 3rd-row seat.","Despite the sea of competitors swimming in the compact-SUV pool, the 2017 Toyota RAV4 remains the gold medal champ. The RAV4 succeeds on so many levels because it doesn’t try to be too many things. The 2017 RAV4 isn’t as off-road-ready as the Jeep Cherokee or Subaru Forester, but it does offer good ground clearance and a capable all-wheel-drive (AWD) system for dealing with deep snow. The RAV4 doesn’t offer lots of expensive engine options and premium features like the Ford Escape, so even well-equipped models remain within reach of the average buyer. On the fuel-economy front, the RAV4 Hybrid uses the same engine technology as the Prius to create the only hybrid-compact SUV in the U.S.","While many compact SUVs have expanded beyond their original concept, Toyota’s 2017 RAV4 knows exactly what it is and who it’s intended to serve. The RAV4’s roomy interior...","Favorite Features 
 
REARVIEW AIDS
 The RAV4’s high ride height, thick pillars and narrow side glass can sometimes make it difficult to park and maneuver. That’s why Toyota offers a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic detection and an available 360-degree Bird’s Eye monitor.
 
 TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P (TSS-P)
 While many compact SUVs offers features like collision-mitigation braking, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and auto high beams, none of them do so as standard equipment on every trim.","","The 2017 Toyota RAV4 gains; Overall, we like the looks of the 2017 RAV4 compact-crossover SUV, and its sharp lines are positively aggressive compared to previous models. Owners of those older models may notice that there's no rear-mounted spare tire on the current generation. However, despite it being a fixture since the RAV4's introduction, Toyota was smart in dropping it, as it allows for a swing-up rear door instead of the swing-out design on previous versions, making it easier to load items into the cargo area. A power assist is standard on Limited and Platinum models, and available on XLE models.","The base RAV4 LE trim comes with Entune, which includes a 6.1-inch display, Bluetooth connectivity, AM/FM/CD system with six speakers, and auxiliary and USB inputs to control your iPod. XLE models add a power moonroof, upgraded Entune with satellite and HD Radio, dual-zone climate control, and better front seats with French stitching. The SE trim receives a sport suspension, paddle shifters, SofTex seating, 2-tone paint and rear cross-traffic alert. Limited models add the power liftgate, SofTex upholstery, Entune Premium audio with navigation and apps, push-button start, and more. The AWD RAV4 Hybrid is offered only in XLE and Limited trims.","Optional Equipment 
All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on all Toyota RAV4 models and standard on the Hybrid, enhancing the SUV's traction in wet weather and on dirt roads. Other options include a navigation system with Toyota's Entune telematics -- which has voice recognition and various apps for everything from making reservations to finding sports scores -- JBL premium audio system with 11 speakers, Bird’s Eye Parking System, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and, on the XLE, a power rear liftgate. The Platinum trim adds body-color side molding, a heated steering wheel, JBL audio, navigation, Smart Key and a foot-activated power rear liftgate.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2017 Toyota RAV4 LE is about $26,700, including the destination charge. The top-of-the-line Platinum model with AWD tops out around $37,200. The XLE Hybrid starts around $30,000. Those prices are right in line with competitors like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, two of its strongest competitors. Other compact SUVs like the Kia Sportage and Mazda CX-5 start lower, but the RAV4's simplified trim levels keep even a loaded RAV4 well below the mid- to high-$30,000 prices that afflict other vehicles in this segment, like the Ford Escape and VW Tiguan. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new Toyota RAV4. The RAV4 should retain its value on par with the Honda CR-V and better than Ford's Escape, but below the Subaru Forester.

If you miss BMW’s small wagons, the 2017 X1 SUV might be a good substitute. Not as bulky as the larger X5, the X1 offers plenty of room for people and cargo plus possesses good maneuverability and visibility, all in a package that offers year-round driving fun.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2017 BMW X1’s ride is firmer than the Lexus NX or Buick Encore, and its price can climb quickly when adding features that are standard on other compact-luxury SUVs. Those needing more room and power could spend less on a non-premium-brand SUV like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.","BMW’s 2017 X1 compact-luxury SUV (BMW likes to call it an SAV, short for Sports Activity Vehicle) may be the company’s smallest offering, but it is no less luxurious or capable than its larger X3 and X5 siblings. Blending the performance characteristics of a BMW 3 Series with the high ride height and all-wheel-drive (AWD) abilities of an SUV, the X1 is easily cross-shopped with a number of vehicles including the Buick Encore, Infiniti QX30, Lexus NX and Mercedes-Benz GLA. With available AWD and a host of modern driver-assist system, the X1 is all about safely having fun. But it’s the little SUV’s brutish exterior and 228-horsepower engine that BMW hopes will attract younger buyers to the family.","We tested the all-wheel-drive xDrive28i and found it to be quite lively and fun to drive. We’re curious to see how the new front-wheel-drive (FWD) sDrive28i compares, especially since it...","Favorite Features 
 
POWER TAILGATE
 Part of the 2017 BMW X1’s standard-equipment roster includes a power-operated rear tailgate. Add the Comfort Access option and you can open the tailgate with a swipe of your leg, a real bonus when your arms are full.
 
 MORE CARGO ROOM
 Despite its rather modest dimensions, BMW’s X1 compact SUV for 2017 offers surprisingly good interior cargo space. Fold down the 40/20/40-split rear seats, and you’ll create 58.7 cubic feet of storage space. Small storage cubbies throughout the cabin further increase the X1’s cargo hauling abilities.","The BMW X1 for 2017 is a 2-row, 5-passenger SUV with plenty of room for people and cargo. Rear-seat passengers have excellent legroom unless the front passengers are so tall they have the front seats in their rearmost position. If this is the case, we recommend spending the additional $300 for the sliding rear-seat option that also reclines. Up front, power seats are standard. This baby BMW's dash is sleek and angular. Materials have a premium look and feel, such as the soft-touch dash and wood accents. The standard SensaTec fake-leather seating feels down-market, though.","Last year’s update injected the 2017 BMW X1 with noticeably more toughness in its design, making it look less like a tall wagon and more like a small SUV. For better or worse, the transformation worked. The X1’s 7.2 inches of ground clearance allows it to venture more securely off-road, while up front BMW's familiar kidney grille, standard LED daytime running lights and optional LED headlights make a strong visual statement and brightly guide your path. The M Sport Package adds further flair with an aerodynamic kit, sport suspension and high-gloss roof rails.","A base 2017 BMW X1 sDrive28i comes with front-wheel drive, while the xDrive28i includes all-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes 8-way-power front seats, automatic climate control, power tailgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, push-button ignition, and 18-inch wheels with run-flat tires. The standard infotainment system includes a 6.5-inch screen, 7-speaker AM/FM/HD Radio/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth audio streaming/phone connectivity. The X1 also includes BMW Assist eCall emergency-request system with an SOS button, complimentary scheduled maintenance for four years/50,000 miles, and roadside assistance for four years/unlimited miles.","Optional Equipment 
As with most BMWs, there are plenty of ways to upgrade the X1, and they can make the vehicle's base price climb quickly. Even most of the X1's exterior paint colors are extra money, unless you go with non-metallic black or white. You'll also pay extra for a rearview camera, a feature that is becoming standard on mainstream SUVs such as the Honda CR-V. Other notable extras include a higher-resolution 8.8-inch monitor, panoramic moonroof, navigation, leather interior, heated front seats, and 12-speaker harman/kardon audio system. New driver-assistance features include lane-departure warning, frontal-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and active cruise control.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2017 BMW X1 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 228 horsepower. BMW promises the X1 can hit the 0-60-mph benchmark in 6.3 seconds. A Sport mode livens throttle response and stiffens steering feel, while Comfort and Eco modes tone down settings. The X1 offers the option of front-wheel or all-wheel drive and uses an 8-speed Aisin automatic transmission. A start/stop system shuts off the engine at idle to save fuel. If you find the restarts jarring, it can be defeated. Premium gasoline is recommended.

 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 BMW X1 sDrive28i has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $34,100, while the AWD xDrive28i bumps the price to just over $36,000. In reality, prices can easily go beyond that by thousands. Loaded, an X1 can hit the upper-$40,000 range. The BMW X1's starting price is in line those of the Lexus NX, Mercedes-Benz GLA and Lincoln MKC, and a few hundred to several thousand dollars more than other compact SUVs such as the Buick Encore, Infiniti QX30 and Volkswagen Tiguan. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new BMW X1. As for its resale value, we expect the 2017 BMW X1 to hold average values below those of the Lexus NX and Mercedes-Benz GLA, on par with the Audi Q3 and better than the Lincoln MKC and Buick Encore.

If you prioritize fuel efficiency over power, most of the QX50's rivals offer more miserly powertrains. And while it may seem a quibble to some, the lack of a power tailgate could be a deal-breaker for others.","The 2017 Infiniti QX50 compact-luxury SUV tends to fly under the radar, but it isn't for lack of value or power.

VALUE PRICING
 Small-luxury SUVs can have big-size price tags, especially when ladled with options. Compared to most rivals -- especially its German ones -- the Infiniti QX50 is a bargain. For well under $40,000 you get a luxury SUV with serious power and a surprising amount of amenities.
 
 POWERED THIS, POWERED THAT
 Among those aforementioned surprising amenities available are a power-adjustable steering wheel and power up-folding rear seats. That latter feature allows you to raise the rear seats from a folded position via the touch of a button, instead of wrestling with them after unloading cargo.","","After a revision last year that granted a much-needed dose of rear legroom and some styling updates, the QX50 sees little change for 2017. Among the few updates is a new 19-inch tire-and-wheel package.; Even with its recent enlargement, the 2017 Infiniti QX50 retains its tidy proportions. At 186.8 inches overall, it's still not that large. With its long hood, tapered roof and flowing windowsill, Infiniti's small crossover SUV also retains its sporty profile. The recent makeover raised the QX50 slightly, giving it a stance more associated with an SUV than the tall","The 2017 Infiniti QX50 comes well equipped out the door with leather seating, power-adjustable and heated front seats, moonroof, dual-zone climate control with rear vents, rearview camera, and push-button ignition. Standard audio entertainment is brought to you by a 6-speaker AM/FM/satellite/CD player with auxiliary and USB, as well as Bluetooth wireless connectivity.","Optional Equipment 
You'd be hard-pressed to find a QX50 without the Premium Package, and for only $700 it's a no-brainer to add. It includes 11-speaker Bose premium audio, power-adjustable steering wheel with entry/exit assist, aluminum roof rails, auto-dimming rearview mirror, HomeLink garage-door opener and advanced climate system with automatic filtration and the ability to close vents when exhaust fumes are detected. There are navigation with real-time traffic, power-up rear seats, bird's-eye-view rearview camera, and front and rear sonar parking aid. Safety highlights include lane-departure warning and prevention, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning and intelligent cruise control. One glaring omission: a power rear tailgate.","Pricing Notes 
 
With a base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $35,445, the 2017 Infiniti QX50 remains a stellar value among small-luxury SUVs. Most buyers will -- and should -- opt for the Premium Package, a screaming deal that adds only $700. Adding AWD is $1,800. Loaded to the gills, a 2017 QX50 still only breaches $45,000. The QX50 is significantly less than rivals like the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5 and Jaguar F-Pace. Undercutting the QX50 is the smaller Lincoln MKC, while the Lexus NX, Acura RDX and new Buick Envision are more in line with the Infiniti's price. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their QX50. Despite flying under the radar, the Infiniti's resale value has tended to hold up well over the years.

Buyers seeking a small, solid, stylish and affordable alternative to more conventional takes on the subcompact crossover-SUV/wagon theme will find the new 2017 Infiniti QX30 a charming, comfortable and capable travel mate.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Anyone desiring a more traditional SUV look or needing maximum people and cargo space would be better served by checking out a roomier alternative like the BMW X1. And while the QX30’s InTouch infotainment system features Infiniti’s latest technology, it doesn’t offer support for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.","Infiniti’s long-overdue entry into the subcompact-crossover SUV segment has an international pedigree that blends German engineering with Japanese design sensibility. Co-developed with Daimler, the QX30’s basic platform mechanicals are largely shared with the Mercedes-Benz GLA250. However the QX30’s exterior styling is unique, as are key details of its more upscale-looking interior, chassis dynamics and powertrain tuning. Available in several trim grades and front-drive or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD) configurations, this new Infiniti faces off against prime rivals like the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Lexus NX 200t as well as its Mercedes corporate cousin. While not the largest or most powerful player in its segment, the QX30 possesses an engaging personality and offers solid value, which many young and even not-so-young urbanites may well find appealing.","With an eye on attracting potential buyers new to the entry-lux crossover-SUV experience, Infiniti did an impressive job of tailoring the QX30 to please nearly any driving taste. Each version...","Favorite Features 
 
SPINAL SUPPORT SEATS
 Standard in every QX30 model, these well-formed buckets borrow design technology from Nissan’s “Zero Gravity” counterparts to more evenly distribute body weight over their surface. In addition to trimming downward pressure on the pelvis and torso, Infiniti says they reduce fatigue levels by 30 percent compared to conventional seat designs.
 
 AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE
 Offered on every QX30, the Technology Package brings a suite of active/passive driver assists that include Blind Spot and Lane Departure Warning, Forward Emergency Braking, adaptive Intelligent Cruise Control and automatic high-beam headlights as well as a 360-degree Around View Monitor and Intelligent Park Assist, both standard on the QX30 Sport.","","The 2017 QX30 is an all-new, entry-level, subcompact-crossover SUV in the Infiniti family of vehicles. Base, Sport or AWD, the QX30 shares major platform and mechanical bits with the; The core design cues on the new QX30 are classic new-gen Infiniti and reflect a contemporary take on the brand’s bold double-arch grille, highly sculpted bodywork, “crescent-cut” C-pillar and LED-infused lighting treatments -- which can be upgraded to full LED-spec across the lineup. Each of the three basic QX30 models also fine-tunes its individual character themes with unique front/rear fascia configurations, ride-height settings and 18-inch or 19-inch wheel/tire fitments with the Sport jettisoning the roof rails that are standard on other variants. AWD models gain SUV-style over-fenders that add a bit more substance to their stance.","A lengthy roster of standards expands as you roll through the QX30’s model hierarchy, but even the base version comes with a full array of power assists, dual-zone climate control, basic Infiniti InTouch with a 7.0-inch touch screen and a Rear View Monitor. Sport models net unique suspension tuning and upgraded seating as well as premium touches like navigation, Bose premium audio, Around View Monitor and a power moonroof, while the QX30 AWD gets its own chassis tweaks and puts the power to all four corners, while offering full Nappa leather trim and even more primo touches.","Optional Equipment 
Most QX30 extras are model-specific. While the QX30 Base and Luxury have no options, the Premium grade can be fitted with a moonroof, navigation, LED lighting, wood cabin trim, roof rails, 19-inch wheels and a Technology Package, which features a full suite of driver assists as well as a Gallery White Theme Package with White Nappa Leather upholstery and bespoke trim accents. Sport-spec options include leather upholstery plus the LED and Technology Packages. Although the QX30 AWD Luxury is option-free, the Premium version can be had with moonroof, navigation, LED/Tech Packages and wood or a dedicated Café Teak interior trim group.","Pricing Notes 
 
An attractive pricing schedule should serve the new Infiniti QX30 lineup well compared to its more costly competitors from Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz. The impressively well-equipped base Infiniti QX30 opens at just under $31,000 while the Sport-spec version that also comes with primo features like navigation, Bose audio and a power moonroof commences closer to $39,500, but ticking all the option boxes can push either just beyond $43,000. The QX30 AWD comes in about $39,000 although maxing out one of these range-toppers will take that number closer to $45,500. With vehicles only starting to reach dealer showrooms, Kelley Blue Book has not yet determined a Fair Purchase Price for the 2017 Infiniti QX30, and residual values along with a 5-year Cost-to-Own stat also are still pending. However based on comparative historic data, we suspect this new Infiniti crossover SUV will be quite competitive in those areas, as well.

If you’re looking for a compact SUV that has more heft and presence than most small crossover SUVs, GMC’s 2017 Terrain might pique your interest. With an available V6, it has plenty of power and can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Its interior amenities are also very upscale.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2017 GMC Terrain compact-crossover SUV might look rugged, but it’s not designed for serious off-road use. The interior is smaller than the Forester or Santa Fe Sport and it lacks some newer collision-avoidance technologies.","GMC’s compact Terrain SUV for 2017 combines rugged good looks with a practical size and good fuel economy. Draped in GMC styling cues, the Terrain plays in the same league as the Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. However, unlike these worthy competitors, the Terrain offers the option of a V6 engine and a more upscale interior. Load up a Denali trim and the Terrain’s price tag quickly moves into Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Ford Escape Titanium territory. The Terrain’s unit-body construction permits it a modern suspension that delivers a comfortable ride and sedan-like handling, and with available all-wheel drive (AWD), year-round driving confidence. Regrettably, the Terrain’s soft suspension and relatively low stance exclude it following the Subaru Forester or Jeep Cherokee off-road.","If a comfortable cabin and quiet ride are high priorities, few compact-crossover SUVs compare to the 2017 GMC Terrain.

DISTINCTIVE EXTERIOR
 GMC’s distinctive exterior styling is applied in full force to the compact 2017 Terrain SUV, giving it a bold, boxy look quite the contrast to vehicles like the Mazda CX-5, Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. We particularly like the new Nightfall package in Onyx Black.
 
 MOVABLE 2ND-ROW SEATS
 GMC’s Terrain compact SUV for 2017 includes a sliding 2nd-row seat that can move fore or aft a full eight inches. When the rear seat isn’t occupied, moving it fully forward can help create much needed cargo space.","","The 2017 GMC Terrain compact SUV gets a new Nightfall package featuring monochromatic treatment and unique wheels in four colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, Graphite Grey and Crimson Red.; If you think an SUV should look tough, then the","The 2017 GMC Terrain compact SUV has a bare-bones SL trim, but we prefer the SLE models that add 17-inch wheels, a rearview camera, color touch-screen radio, heated outside mirrors, USB port with iPod support, Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, XM Satellite Radio, and OnStar with 4G LTE connectivity that can be shared (for a fee) as a Wi-Fi connection. We like the additional quiet thanks to the active noise-cancellation system, and the rear seat features sliders that move back and forth eight inches to help with legroom.","Optional Equipment 
The two most noteworthy options for GMC’s 2017 Terrain crossover SUV are the 3.6-liter V6 engine and all-wheel drive. But there's more. Upper trim levels add leather seating and a navigation system, and on SLE-2, SLT and Denali trims, active safety features like forward-collision alert, blind-spot detection and lane-departure warning. A 2nd-row entertainment system with two independent screens will keep the kids occupied on long trips. Other options include a 10-gigabyte music-storage hard drive, Pioneer audio and a programmable rear liftgate that can be set to open at a desired height.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 GMC Terrain SL's Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starts at about $25,000, including destination, while the SLE-1 starts just over $28,000. Mid-level SLE2 and leather-clad SLT SUV models start at about $29,700 and $32,000, respectively. The Terrain Denali starts around $35,200. AWD adds about $1,750 on all models. While the Denali certainly has flash, you can get most of the same equipment on the mid-level SLE2 and SLT models, and save quite a bit of cash. Notable competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, all of which cost less than the Terrain, but come with less standard equipment. Be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to see what others are paying in your area, and note that the Terrain should hold its value well over the years, better than the Dodge Journey, but still behind the segment residual leader, the Honda CR-V.

Lexus’ NX 200t and NX 300h for 2017 deliver all the high-tech features and elegant luxury expected of a Lexus in a compact package that is both fun to drive and easy to live with. The hybrid’s city fuel economy surpasses its rivals by a wide margin.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need a luxury SUV big enough to handle four adults, some large dogs or just lots of cargo, a larger RX 350 might make a better choice. Those who find the NX’s styling a bit too over the top might prefer an Audi Q3 or a BMW X1.","The 2017 Lexus NX small-luxury-crossover SUV hasn’t changed much from its introduction in 2015, which says a lot about just how well Lexus nailed the design. Loosely based on the Toyota RAV4 platform, the NX brings its own powertrains that include a turbocharged 4-cylinder on the NX 200t and a 4-cylinder hybrid setup in the NX 300h. Visually, the NX is quite the standout and its fun-to-drive quotient is quite high. The small platform doesn’t seem to have hampered interior designers who have created a roomy and upscale environment worthy of the Lexus badge. You can get into a sportier Infiniti QX30 or Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class for much less, but neither of these rivals offers a hybrid option.","When a car’s ride and handling fulfill the promises made by its flashy exterior, it’s a win-win. In the 2017 Lexus NX 200t, a stellar reliability record adds a third...","Favorite Features 
 
2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE
 Lexus’ first foray into the world of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines is a resounding success. Sophisticated techniques, such as building the turbocharger into the exhaust manifold, help banish turbo lag while improving smoothness and acceleration.
 
 DESIGN
 Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder. The 2017 Lexus NX may be controversial to some, timeless art to others, but it will always prompt discussion. That’s more than can be said for many of its rather generic-looking competitors.","It's no surprise that the cutting-edge exterior of a car looking like the 2017 NX has a cutting-edge interior. And we do mean edge, as the multiple levels, cutlines, materials and finishes could distract some drivers. Schizophrenic design choices aside, there's no mistaking the quality. From the stitched material on the dash to the many soft and padded surfaces, the Lexus NX exudes the sophistication of a higher class of vehicle than what you're actually driving. The new touch-pad interface for the Remote Touch is an improvement, but still not as intuitive as touch-screen or knob-based systems.","It used to be that Lexus vehicles were so understated they were boring. Not anymore. From its dramatically gaping grille, to the intricately detailed LED headlights, to the 3-dimensional sculpting of the taillights that you have to touch to really understand, the 2017 Lexus NX takes everything you thought you knew about Lexus styling, folds it up into a crazy shape, and throws it back in your face. It doesn't always work -- the nose, for example, protrudes Durante-like in profile -- but overall it's nicely executed and at the very least is a welcome break from previous humdrum Lexus vehicles.","The compact 2017 NX SUV is as feature-packed and nicely equipped as the Lexus badge on the nose suggests. There are things you'd expect, like power seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. And a few others, such as the standard Lexus Display Audio with its 7-inch screen, voice recognition and the ability to divide the screen into three sections. There's LED interior lighting, plus LED taillights and low-beam headlights. The Drive Mode Select function altering throttle response among Normal, Eco and Sport modes is standard, as is advanced stability control.","Optional Equipment 
Options for the 2017 Lexus NX extend beyond all-wheel drive for the NX 200t or a hybrid powertrain in the AWD NX 300h hybrid. A Navigation Package includes the Lexus Enform system, which adds Bing, Yelp, iHeartRadio and other apps, including maintenance reminders. The Remote Touch Interface uses a touch-pad controller that's slightly less fiddly than the mouse-like shuttle in other Lexus vehicles. The Leather package includes the Comfort and Premium packages, which add driver's-seat memory, and heated and ventilated front seats. The sporty set will like the aluminum pedals and sport-tuned suspension that come with the F Sport.","Under the Hood 
 
The standard engine in Lexus’ 2017 NX 200t is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. If you measure performance by the infrequency of your visits to the gas pump, the NX 300h hybrid may be more your speed, with its combination of 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and electric motor putting out a total of 194 horsepower. This runs through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), but with a twist: Floor the throttle, and it activates a kick-down switch, immediately giving you full power. The NX 200t is available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), while the hybrid is offered only in AWD. Note that the turbo requires premium fuel, while the hybrid is happy with regular unleaded.

If you want all-wheel drive, bring an extra $1,400. The hybrid starts notably higher, at nearly $41,000. Note that the NX is priced higher than competitors like the Audi Q3, Infiniti QX30 and BMW X1, all of which start closer to $30,000; it's even about $1,000 higher than the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class.

Acura’s RDX compact-luxury SUV for 2017 combines sporty good looks with impressive power and handling in a package that isn’t overly complex or ornate. The RDX’s reasonable pricing is bolstered by its ability to hold its value better than almost all challengers.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for a modern compact-luxury SUV with high fuel-economy figures or a hybrid powertrain, the Lexus NX or diesel-powered BMW X3 xDrive28d might be better options. Those looking for a rugged off-road SUV should look to either Land Rover or Jeep.","The 2017 Acura RDX compact-luxury-crossover SUV has been around for a number of years, all of which have seen sales success to make the competition green with envy. Where competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Lexus NX use turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, the RDX sticks with a robust V6 teamed to a smooth-shifting automatic powering either the front or all four wheels. With seating for five passengers and a decent-sized cargo bay, the RDX makes a great luxury SUV for those who don’t need the added size and extra cost of the larger MDX. Acura’s full suite of luxury, technology and safety features is here, as is its unimpeachable reputation for reliability and excellent resale.","Other than its average fuel-economy ratings, we find very little objectionable when driving the 2017 Acura RDX. The 3.5-liter V6 delivers its power smoothly with plenty of low-end torque for...","Favorite Features 
 
ACURA/ELS SURROUND SOUND
 The RDX for 2017 doesn’t need 20 speakers in every door to pull off amazing sound quality. The Acura ELS audio system is so well engineered and fine-tuned, it blows the coils off systems costing twice as much. Fortunately, it’s incredibly affordable.
 
 ADVANCE PACKAGE
 The 2017 RDX compact-luxury-crossover SUV offers the Advance Package that includes every available feature offered on the RDX in one simple grouping. Add in all-wheel drive and you’re looking at price tag around $45,000.","The 2017 Acura RDX gets a few color revisions to its interior trim this year, but that’s about it. Acura’s dual-screen infotainment system presents a cleanly styled interface devoid of the multitude of buttons found on some competitors. Other touches of note include soft-touch materials, an available 8-way-power passenger seat, 10-way-power driver's seat and a smart use of space for both passengers and cargo. For example, if the comfortable rear seats aren't holding passengers, they quickly fold forward to create up to about 77 cubic feet of cargo space.","Fresh from an update last year, the 2017 Acura RDX SUV carries over its subtle tweaks that bring it in line with the more modern design language of the brand. Brilliant Jewel Eye headlights flank a revised 3-dimensional grille design, while around back the RDX’s taillights have the same signature look as the rest of the Acura lineup. The RDX’s face and tail liven up the overall package, which, although conservatively handsome, lags behind more radical designs like the Lexus NX and","Most of the luxury SUV competitors the RDX faces don't have the long list of standard features as the Acura, and fewer still at the price. The 2017 Acura RDX comes with things like dual-zone climate control, a 10-way-power driver's seat, active noise cancellation, a multi-view rearview camera, and a 7-speaker/360-watt AM/FM/CD audio system with a 5-inch LCD display, USB/auxiliary inputs, voice-activated text messaging and Pandora Internet radio. Safety features include six airbags, stability and traction control, and Acura's ACE body structure, which has helped it earn top crash-test ratings from both the government and the insurance industry.","Optional Equipment 
While Acura tends to divide its major options into different model levels, Acura’s 2017 RDX breaks with this rule by offering the AcuraWatch package as a stand-alone option on all models, except the Advance Package, which includes it. AcuraWatch bundles adaptive cruise control, forward-collision braking and warning, and lane-keeping assist and departure warning in one package. All-wheel drive (AWD) is also available across the board. Navigation is available on the Technology and Advance packages, while the Advance adds luxury touches like ventilated front seats, blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors, remote starting, and automatic windshield wipers.","Under the Hood 
 
You wouldn't know that the Acura RDX for 2017 has a 3.5-liter V6 engine just from looking at the specs, as an engine of this size in a luxury-performance vehicle usually produces 300-plus horsepower. Still, performance is strong in the RDX, which routes its power through a 6-speed automatic transmission, either to the front wheels (FWD) or through Acura's AWD with Intelligent Control system.
 
 3.5-liter V6
 279 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm
 252 lb-ft of torque @ 4,900 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/28 mpg (FWD), 19/27 mpg (AWD)
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base front-wheel-drive 2017 Acura RDX starts at about $36,500, including the $940 destination charge. All-wheel drive adds about $1,500 to the price of any 2017 RDX, while AcuraWatch adds $1,300. The most you'll find yourself paying is about $45,000, a pretty solid bargain for such a nicely equipped vehicle. We think it's a good idea to spend the extra $1,300 on the AcuraWatch package, as it adds a significant amount of convenience and safety for a relatively small sum. At these prices, a new RDX undercuts almost every rival except the smaller Infiniti QX30 and Lincoln MKC. The Volvo XC60 and Infiniti QX50 are in the same ballpark, and the Germans can be $15,000 higher when they're loaded up. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that the Acura RDX boasts some of the highest resale values in its class.

Save for personal styling preferences, there’s not a great deal to ding in this latest iteration of the Escape. The Mazda CX-5 has more sporting character and the Honda CR-V offers marginally more cargo space, but Ford’s highly adaptable hauler makes an impressive case for itself on every functional front.","Strategically updated for 2017, the Ford Escape becomes an even more attractive alternative in the popular compact-SUV segment that includes the Honda CR-V, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, Mazda CX-5, Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and Toyota RAV4. Tasteful but effective exterior restyling enhances the Escape’s curb appeal while a comprehensive remake of its roomy, comfortable 5-passenger cabin elevates both visual sophistication and user-friendliness. Available in S/SE/Titanium trims and front- or all-wheel drive, the 2017 Escape also introduces a host of advanced tech touches including Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system with Sync Connect along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

 Standard on Titanium and available on SE, the 2017 Escape debuts the most sophisticated form of Ford’s Sync 3 system to date. It now includes support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay while offering a new Sync Connect feature that lets owners remotely control various vehicle functions using their smartphone.
 
 ADVANCED DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMS
 Ford has materially elevated the Escape’s selection of available driver assists for 2017 by making Lane Keeping Alert/Lane Keeping Aid, Adaptive Cruise Control and Collision Warning with brake support, Automatic High Beams and Enhanced Active Park Assist new options on the top-line Titanium model.","The 2017 Escape benefits from a wide-ranging remake that imparts a new level of visual and functional sophistication. Virtually every touch surface has been revised to create a more premium look and feel. The Escape’s new electronic parking brake and repositioned shift lever ease access to the climate controls and new center-stack media bin with USB port and 12V power point. Other key revamps include a more user-friendly multifunction steering wheel, re-contoured front buckets, a larger center armrest and bigger covered console bin. Dropping the 60/40 fold-flat rear seat doubles the usable storage area from 34.0 to 68.0 cubic feet.","While its basic bodywork is unchanged, the Escape gains more visual refinement for 2017 thanks to a well-focused facelift and tail tweak. The recast nose boasts an edgier character defined by a new soft cap, more prominent hexagonal grille – which conceals active shutters on any Escape with an EcoBoost engine -- sleeker LED-infused headlights and larger outboard air intakes along with a redrawn aluminum hood. The rear redesign nets a new tailgate stamping, reshaped LED lights and more tasteful detailing. There’s also a new Sport Appearance Package that brings blackout trim accents, halogen headlights and 19-inch Ebony Black alloy wheels.","Ford has upped the Escape’s features roster across the board for 2017. The entry S model offers a full complement of power assists, tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless entry, a rearview camera and AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control and Torque Vectoring Control, while the SE ups that ante with dual-zone climate control, steering-wheel-mounted shifter paddles, a power driver’s seat and alloy wheels. The top-line Titanium model upgrades from cloth trim to full leather and gets dual power front seats, a 10-speaker Sony premium audio system, Sync 3 with Sync Connect, push-button/remote start, a 110-volt rear power outlet and hands-free power liftgate.","Optional Equipment 
While the extras roster on an Escape S is limited to things like remote start and alloy wheels, SE buyers can add leather, a hands-free power liftgate, Cold Weather/Technology/Sport Appearance packages, the latter -- along with a Towing Package and Glass Panoramic Vista Roof -- also can be fitted to the Titanium.

The Escape offers three engine choices for 2017, each backed by a 6-speed SelectShift automatic. Sole carryover is the 168-horsepower 2.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder that’s confined to the front-drive-only Escape S. Whether FWD or AWD, the SE and Titanium can be had with two new smooth, responsive and more powerful 4-cylinder EcoBoost alternatives, both fitted with efficiency-enhancing start/stop systems. The standard force-fed 1.5-liter makes 179 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, sufficient to up the tow rating from 1,500 to 2,000 pounds, while the optional 2.0-liter cranks out 245 ponies and 275 lb-ft of torque and ups trailering capacity to a class-leading 3,500 pounds.

Ford has adopted a more aggressive pricing policy for the 2017 Escape to make it even more competitive in a segment that now accounts for 17 percent of all new-vehicle sales in America. While the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on the low-volume Escape S has risen by $500 and now opens under $24,000, the high-volume SE and range-topping Titanium variants have been trimmed by $200 and $405, respectively, to just under $26,000 and $30,000. Upgrades like the 2.0-liter engine, AWD, panoramic glass roof and Tech Package can bring those numbers to just under $35,000 and $37,000. KBB has not yet released a 5-Year Cost to Own figure for the 2017 Escape, but historically, the Escape’s residual value percentages have been average and well below the class-leading Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.

In addition, it's neither as quick as the turbocharged Kia Sportage SX, nor as nimble as a Mazda CX-5.","Third generation is charmed for the Hyundai Tucson, as this version of the compact-crossover SUV gets just about everything right. Previous versions were competent, but not quite competitive with the class-leading Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape. This third generation gets it right, though, with Hyundai reinventing its 5-passenger compact SUV with an eye-catching exterior design, the latest technology and safety aids like automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and an available 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that gets up to 32 mpg. A lease-only hydrogen-powered fuel-cell version based on the last-gen platform remains available, but only in California. With a starting price of under $24,000 and improvements upon its former self in almost every category, the Tucson takes on the segment's best.","The first thing you'll notice about the 2017 Tucson is Hyundai's efforts to keep things quiet and comfortable.

 The compact SUV is the de facto family car these days, so stain-resistant fabric should be a no-brainer. Not only does YES Essentials fabric technology resist stains, it helps repel foul odors and even reduces static electricity.","The base Hyundai Tucson SE offers a 6-way-manual seat, but skip that and move up to the Sport or Eco, which comes with an 8-way-power seat with lumbar. The sensible dash offers big vents, simple instrumentation, and buttons and knobs for climate and audio controls, even if you opt for a higher-end model and its touch-screen interface. Simplicity extends to the digital display between the gauges, which doesn't overload the driver with info. Even if it's not best-in-class roomy, the comfortable rear seat works just fine, and the cargo area's adjustable floor also includes storage for the cargo cover.","There's no question the 2017 Tucson is a sharp-looking compact SUV. The big grille, flowing lines and LED-accented headlights bring it into the same fold as the","The 2017 Hyundai Tucson SE is the least expensive, and offers what we consider the basics on a modern vehicle: rearview camera, Bluetooth- and USB-equipped audio system, 17-inch alloy wheels, and an automatic transmission for the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. But it's better to step up to the Eco model, where you'll get rear air-conditioning vents, an 8-way-power driver's seat, and the more powerful AND fuel-efficient 1.6-liter turbo engine along with its 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. A half-step up from that is the Sport, which adds blind-spot monitoring, heated front seats, push-button start, and a power liftgate with the proximity-open feature. Fuel cell models are nicely equipped for being based on the old platform, but one of their best features is unlimited complimentary hydrogen refueling.","Optional Equipment 
All-wheel drive is available on every trim level, but if you really want to load up, head straight for the Tucson Limited. It includes leather seating, LED headlights and taillights, a chrome grille and door handles, a power passenger seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. There's also an upgraded infotainment system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with its 8-inch touch-screen, 405-watt/8-speaker audio system, and Hyundai's Blue Link 2.0 smartphone interface.

Base Tucson SE models get a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission, which is a bit of a dog. Choose Eco, Sport or Limited to get the much better 1.6-liter turbo-4 and 7-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available with either engine in lieu of the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) setup. AWD Tucson models offer a ""lock"" feature, ensuring up to a 50/50 torque split between the front and rear wheels for better grip in low-traction situations. And don't equate ""turbo"" with ""speed""; instead, the upgrade engine successfully concentrates on fuel economy, getting up to 32 mpg in Eco models, on regular unleaded gas. Hydrogen models use an advanced system that turns the element into electricity to power a motor. The 37-gallon tank can be filled in less than 10 minutes.

You can get a 2017 Hyundai Tucson SE with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $23,600, but we suggest skipping that and heading to the better-equipped Eco model, which starts at a bit more than $25,000. Sport models kick off at about $26,800, while the top-line Limited will run about $30,600. All-wheel drive adds $1,400 to any Tucson's starting price. If you opt for the Ultimate package on the 2017 Tucson Limited, you'll be looking at about $35,000 worth of compact SUV. That's pretty favorable next to the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue, and is nearly identical to the Ford Escape. The Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell is limited to select California buyers and is offered only as a lease for $499/month for 36 months with $2,999 down. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Tucson. Residual values for the Tucson are about on par with the rest of the compact-SUV class.

If you want a smaller luxury SUV that's safe, stylish, loaded with creature comforts and touts the stiffer driving dynamics associated with European cars, put the XC60 on your list. At up to 30 mpg, this Volvo has respectable fuel economy, too.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Volvo XC60 doesn't have the very latest infotainment offerings, such as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto capability. If velvety ride comfort is a priority, check out the Lexus RX or Buick Envision. With the revisions for 2017, you'll have to go elsewhere if you crave a V6.","The 2017 Volvo XC60 is a compact-luxury SUV from the Swedish automaker that competes with European rivals like the Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5 and BMW X3, not to mention the Lexus RX, Acura RDX and Cadillac XT5. It's a competitive field for sure, and the fact the XC60 is among the oldest in its class makes standing out even harder. While an all-new model arrives soon, the 2017 XC60 still merits attention. Its once-cutting-edge safety systems like the ability to automatically brake if it senses a collision or detects pedestrians in its path are notable. This Volvo crossover SUV also boasts stylish design, a wealth of standard features, potent yet efficient engines and classy interiors, all at a price that starts under $42,000.","Volvo’s XC60 has always felt quick, and that attribute remains even though it exclusively uses 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines for 2017. These aren't ordinary 4-bangers: The one in T5 models is...","Favorite Features 
 
DRIVE-E TECHNOLOGY
 Yes, the name sounds odd, and it has nothing to do with electric propulsion, but Volvo's new engines are energetic and efficient. Through the use of turbocharging or -- in the case of the XC60 T6 -- turbocharging and supercharging, these engines wring out lots of power despite their small size.
 
 ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES
 City Safety is Volvo’s system that can automatically apply the brakes at speeds up to 31 mph if it senses a forward collision and the driver fails to brake. Optional is another system that can detect pedestrians and bicyclists and will brake the vehicle at even higher speeds to avoid an accident.","","The 2017 XC60 lineup is trimmed to four main variants and two major lines: the sporty-looking Dynamic or more traditional Inscription. The old 5- and 6-cylinder engines are gone, leaving a turbocharged 4-cylinder or a supercharged and turbocharged 4-cylinder. An all-new version is around the corner in the; Volvo design has been sleek and stylish so long that we've nearly forgotten those old boxy shapes. The 2017 Volvo XC60 embodies that aesthetic, featuring a graceful profile and proportions. It all hides a functional vehicle, with low roof rails to reduce wind noise, and an optional crossbar system to carry bikes, kayaks, skis and more. Dynamic trims have black accents and darkened wheels. Top-line T6 R-Design models eschew off-road ability for on-pavement performance, with stylish 20-inch wheels and a sport-tuned suspension. Stick with non-R-Design models if you regularly churn through snow or mud. All models feature a panoramic roof.","With Volvo's shuffling of the 2017 XC60 lineup, this premium-compact SUV is even better equipped out the gate. Whether you opt for a base XC60 T5 in Dynamic or Inscription form, it will come with leather seating, panoramic moonroof, power-adjustable front seats, 40/20/40-folding rear seats, and an infotainment system that bundles navigation system, HD Radio, CD player and Bluetooth phone connectivity. The Volvo XC60's many standard safety features include blind-spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert, rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and the City Safety low-speed collision-avoidance system.","Optional Equipment 
In addition to the stronger engine, T6 models feature all-wheel drive (AWD) as standard (it's optional on T5 models), larger wheels and power tailgate (also optional on T5 models). Along with its sport-tuned chassis, the top-line XC60 R-Design variant has many of the other options available on lower models, including adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, xenon headlights and harman/kardon audio system. Other goodies for 2017 include heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, integrated rear booster seats, rear-seat DVD entertainment system with two screens, power-folding rear headrests and power-retractable side mirrors.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volvo XC60 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $42,000 for a base T5 Dynamic or Inscription model. That is a few thousand more than last year, but this newer version has more features. The more powerful T6 model starts over $47,000, while the top-line XC60 R-Design begins just under $52,000. Option packages can tack on thousands more. At these prices, the XC60 now nearly mirrors rivals like the Mercedes-Benz GLC, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Lexus RX. The Acura RDX and Infiniti QX50 continue to tempt with prices starting in the mid-$30K range, as does the new Buick Envision. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Volvo SUV. The XC60's resale value is expected to hold up fairly well, but still trail leaders like the Lexus RX and Audi Q5.

The Discovery Sport’s capable off-road suspension makes for a rather firm on-road ride. Those seeking a powerful V6 or diesel engine are out of luck, and the Sport’s 9-speed automatic isn’t the most responsive transmission we’ve ever tested. Being relatively new, long-term reliability data has yet to be established.","Land Rover designed the 2017 Discovery Sport luxury SUV to go head-to-head with better-established names such as the Audi Q5, Volvo XC60 and BMW X3. But, unlike these worthy rivals, the Discovery Sport SUV isn’t just about an opulent interior and advanced safety and entertainment options. Land Rover’s Discovery Sport is one luxury SUV that can actually conquer some serious off-road obstacles. Land Rover’s advanced all-wheel-drive Terrain Response system makes novice off-roaders look like pros, leaving vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz GLK waiting for a tow. Yet for all of its aristocratic heritage, the Discovery Sport has a commoner’s price starting well below $40,000, and that includes partial leather seating and all-wheel drive.","The 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport possesses all the luxury credentials expected of a $40,000 SUV.

ON-ROAD ELEGANCE, OFF-ROAD GRIT
 Regardless of weather, road conditions or location, the 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport has the power to impress country club elites and outdoor adventurers alike.
 
 FIXED PANORAMIC ROOF
 Available on higher trim levels, Land Rover’s 2017 Discovery Sport’s fixed-glass roof panel spans nearly the entire cabin length, giving every passenger a great view of the sky above without all the wind and noise of a conventional sunroof.","","For 2017, Land Rover’s Discovery Sport SUV gains a new Dynamic Design Pack option and four new colors. The InControl Touch Pro infotainment system is made available, as are new driver-assist features including Driver Condition Monitor, Intelligent Speed Monitor and Lane Keep Assist.; The Land Rover Discovery Sport is shorter than competitors, but it's also wider, giving it an edge when it comes to stability. The steeply sloped windshield helps keep wind noise to nearly nonexistent levels, depending on speed. The short overhangs in the front and rear give it generous approach and departure angles -- that means it can tackle steep slopes without scraping -- and it can even","For a luxury SUV starting under $40,000, the 2017 Discovery Sport SE comes nicely equipped. All-wheel drive is standard, as is the Terrain Response System, Hill Descent Control, push-button start, partial leather seating, power-adjustable front seats, USB media and charging ports in the first row, plus two 2nd-row USB charging ports. A 10-speaker audio/infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity is also standard. If you want full leather seating and the panoramic sunroof, you'll have to move up one trim level to the Discovery Sport HSE.","Optional Equipment 
Stand-alone options and packages are available for the Discovery Sport SE, HSE and HSE LUX and include keyless entry and heated front and rear seats on the SE model, plus smart safety features like automatic traffic detection, high-beam assist, surround camera system, adaptive headlights and emergency braking on the HSE and HSE Lux versions. The HSE and Lux trims can come with a heated steering wheel and windshield, head-up display, upgraded audio and adaptive suspension. We’d skip the Meridian audio upgrade and Touch Pro navigation system as your smartphone's voice commands coming through the standard Bluetooth setup will always get you home.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport is the least expensive Land Rover model available, with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $38,700 including the $995 destination charge. We suggest the more lavishly equipped Discovery Sport HSE, which starts at a still reasonable $43,200. If you want all the bells and whistles, and bragging rights to spending the most, head for the $47,000 Discovery Sport HSE Lux; once you've added in all the various options, you're looking at a price tag well north of $60,000. We still recommend the HSE first for the longest-lasting satisfaction, though the SE model will also earn your pride.

At resale time, the Audi Q5 is a little better, while the BMW X3 slots well below.

The pricing structure for the 2017 Nissan Rogue is very direct: S (base), SV (more standard features -- this level is our strongest recommendation), and SL (top-of-the-line). A base Rogue S model (no Hybrid at this level) starts at $24,760. The gasoline-only Rogue SV begins at $28,530, with the SV Hybrid starting $1,000 higher. At the top tier, the Rogue SL is $30,900, with a $1,200 premium for the Rogue SL Hybrid, which includes LED headlights as standard equipment. You can add all-wheel drive to any of these models for $1,350. These prices run fairly close to comparably equipped competitive models, with the exception of the feature-richer Kia Sportage. Before you can make your best deal, check the KBB Fair Purchase Price for a better idea of what Rogues are going for in your neighborhood.

Miss the ride comfort and cargo hauling abilities of small luxury wagon? The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA is just that, only those crafty Germans have disguised it to look like a small-luxury SUV. The AMG version delivers scintillating performance, while 4Matic all-wheel drive can help tackle winter’s worst.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Those seeking actual off-road ability in a small SUV would be better served spending $35,000 on a Subaru Outback, Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk or Land Rover Evoque. Those who prefer the security of carrying a spare tire won’t feel very good about the GLA’s run-flat-only option.","Mercedes-Benz has left its comfort zone to create a radical compact SUV unlike anything before it. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA small-luxury-crossover SUV takes aim at the BMW X1, Infiniti QX30 and Lexus NX, offering Mercedes’ engineering, luxury and performance at a price starting under $34,000. Despite its very un-SUV-like profile, the compact GLA is surprisingly roomy, although you’ll find more cargo and passenger space in an Audi Q3 and Land Rover Evoque. A pair of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines borrowed from the MB CLA sedan supply power to the GLA250 and high-performance Mercedes-AMG GLA45 SUVs. Because of its taut suspensions and low ground clearance, the GLA is more appealing to driving enthusiasts rather than weekend campers needing true off-road ability.","With Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 GLA luxury-crossover SUV, when it comes time to decide who will drive and who will ride shotgun, don’t be surprised if a scuffle ensues. With the Mercedes-AMG...","Favorite Features 
 
DOWNHILL SPEED REGULATION
 This feature is nice to have when creeping down slippery inclines or gravel-strewn trails. The 2017 MB GLA’s Hill Descent Control holds the vehicle at a slow set speed so the driver doesn’t have to constantly ride the brake.
 
 PANORAMA SUNROOF
 The Mercedes-Benz GLA for 2017 offers a dual-pane panoramic sunroof so large that when open it makes the GLA feel more like a Jeep Wrangler. A power sunshade keeps things cool in the summer, or can be retracted to let sunlight stream into the cabin.","Though the 2017 GLA luxury-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz feels somewhat coupe-like from the front seats (which is no accident -- after all, it’s essentially based on the so-called 4-door-coupe format of the CLA), rear passengers are met with more generous headroom thanks to the GLA’s 3.5-inch-taller SUV profile. As such, this bubble-like greenhouse is bestowed with poplar, burled-walnut or aluminum trim options, which make it feel rather upscale in spite of its accessible price point. Those who won’t spring for leather will get the faux -- but convincing -- MB-Tex upholstery instead.","You can tell a lot about a car by its available colors, and the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA250’s available palette suggests a level of playful sophistication and maturity that you simply can’t find in other accessible offerings. Names like Kryptonite Green Metallic, Jupiter Red and designo Magno Mountain Grey should give you a clue. AMG versions receive the obligatory aggressive body treatment, while an optional Aerodynamics Package goes to 11 with a larger front splitter and a big roof spoiler.","Mercedes’ 2017 GLA250 luxury SUV comes with an impressive list of safety items, including collision prevention with autonomous braking and attention assist. Other unexpected standard items include an off-road mode with hill-descent control and a graphical representation of suspension and steering settings with 4Matic versions. Engine stop/start, keyless start and a power liftgate round out the list of off-the-shelf items you might not expect in a reasonably priced Mercedes-Benz. Standard run-flat tires are a must as a spare tire is not included in the GLA’s limited cargo area.","Optional Equipment 
If you’re smitten with the AMG model’s looks but are stuck with a standard-sized budget, the Sport Package adds meaner bodywork and 19-inch, 5-spoke AMG wheels. Available convenience items include blind-spot assistance, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, and park assist, which helps find a parking spot and takes the reins by steering the GLA into the open space.","Under the Hood 
 
Both of the 2017 GLA’s engine offerings are mated to 7-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The lineup’s powerplants couldn’t be more different in terms of spec, however -- the GLA250’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the Mercedes-AMG GLA45’s yields 355 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque (as well as a more aggressively programmed transmission). The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV is available in front- or in all-wheel-drive 4Matic trim (FWD, AWD), the latter being standard on the AMG trim.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (GLA250)
 208 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (FWD), 23/31 mpg (AWD)
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Mercedes-AMG GLA45)
 355 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm
 332 lb-ft of torque @ 2,250-5,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg
 
Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
In front-drive form, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV starts just under $33,800, with the AWD version about $2,000 more. At that mark, the GLA represents a solid value considering its quality interior and generous standard equipment. If you don’t mind keeping it somewhat simple by forgoing expensive options, you should be able to purchase a new GLA for less than you might think. The AMG version commands around $51,000, but the sportier model also delivers a fiercer, more mature driving experience. To get a good idea of what others are paying in your area, be sure to check out our Fair Purchase Price. Value should also work in the new GLA’s favor, as Mercedes vehicles tend to hold their value more than most, better than the Lincoln MKC, Audi Q3, Lexus NX and BMW X1, but on par with the Land Rover Evoque.

If you want a small-luxury sedan that is stylish, efficient, and – most of all – a Mercedes-Benz, the CLA-Class can be yours at a price not much higher than that of a mainstream car. Buyers with deeper pockets seeking a sleeper will have a blast in the high-performance AMG CLA45.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The CLA's rear seats are tiny, so if you frequently carry rear passengers or plan to in the future, you may want to make the stretch to a larger model like the C-Class or GLC SUV, or check out the Audi A3 instead.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class is the least expensive car in the German automaker's lineup but packs plenty of features that make it desirable beyond mere badge appeal. Billed as a coupe but in reality a 4-door sedan, the CLA is also among the newest Mercedes models. Like the also-fresh Audi A3, Acura ILX and forthcoming Infiniti Q30, the CLA-Class is positioned to lure young up-and-comers to the luxury brand with its small size and sub-$33,000 starting price. The front- or all-wheel-drive CLA250 is the base model, while the AMG CLA45 is a $50,000, 375-horsepower all-wheel-drive rocket. The CLA has a cramped rear seat and a price that easily ascends, but for aspirational buyers seeking entry into the Mercedes-Benz brand, this is their ticket in.","Much has been made about the CLA250 being Mercedes-Benz's first front-wheel-drive (FWD) car. But the reality is that you'd be hard-pressed to tell what wheels were doing the hard work...","Favorite Features 
 
PANORAMA ROOF 
The snug CLA cabin benefits from the extra glass of the panoramic sunroof option. Open it up, and you're treated to near- convertible levels of sunshine. Alternatively, you can just leave the glass exposed, creating the illusion of additional headroom. 
 
AMG CLA45 4MATIC 
It's anything but cheap, but it's hard not to marvel at the performance numbers of this top-line CLA-Class. With 2016 arrive 20 more horsepower and an additional 18 lb-ft of torque, making a total of 375 horsepower/350 lb-ft – all from a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine.","As we've mentioned, the CLA-Class has a cramped rear seat and isn't the best choice if you regularly carrry more than yourself and a passenger. But we wager this isn't a factor for most shoppers considering the CLA. And they'll find much to like in the front, where a standard 7-inch display, sturdy-looking air vents and a thick steering wheel give an air of elegance. A split-folding rear seat adds versatility to Mercedes' smallest sedan, while the two front seats now offer more comfort with their adjustable cushion length. The standard MB-Tex faux leather seats do a good job mimicking genuine hide.","While it may look like Mercedes-Benz simply took its prettiest sedan – the CLS that Mercedes also calls a coupe – and left it in the dryer too long to create the CLA-Class, there's more to it. Still, the swooping architecture translates well to the smaller car, making it look longer and wider than it really is, at least in isolation. However, the illusion breaks in traffic, when you notice how little of its lane it occupies. The low stance, narrow tires and clean shape give the CLA250 a slip-through-the-air drag coefficient of only 0.23. The new Night Package adds black 18-inch wheels.","Even the least expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan offers many standard features. Among them are dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 12-way-power driver's seat with memory and a brake-hold feature that applies the brake for you at stoplights. The CLA's infotainment system includes AM/FM/HD Radio with CD player, USB port and Bluetooth streaming, all seen and controlled by the 7-inch display and command dial. The CLA250 boasts impressive safety features including systems that detect driver drowsiness (Attention Assist) and Collision Prevention Assist, which uses radar to warn the driver of a potential collision and, if necessary, even applies the brakes for you.","Optional Equipment

You have your choice of engines in Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sedan. The CLA250 gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 208 horsepower, available in either FWD or AWD. The CLA45 AMG version of that engine puts out an astonishing 375 horsepower to all four wheels. The AMG engine is the first 4-cylinder engine from Mercedes-Benz's in-house tuning branch. Both are mated to 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions. At up to 38 mpg, the CLA-Class can be remarkably fuel-efficient, but keep in mind this Mercedes requires premium gasoline.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,000. Add AWD and you're looking at $2,000 more, and when you start adding option packages, this ""inexpensive"" Mercedes-Benz can easily swell toward $40,000. However, at $35,000, you're looking at a lot of car with plenty of options. The CLA45 AMG starts considerably higher, at over $50,000. However, even that is a bargain of sorts, since it's the least expensive AMG-badged model you can get. The Audi A3, a subcompact-luxury rival, starts slightly less than the Mercedes CLA-Class, while the Acura ILX is several thousand below. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's residual value is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.

If you’re seeking a compact car that still knows how to pamper and please its occupants, the 2017 Buick Verano deserves a good look. The Verano offers numerous high-tech safety and comfort features, and the little Buick’s ride is far softer than most foreign small cars.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re a person who loves to push your car hard in the turns, a more driver-oriented model such as the Mazda3, Ford Focus ST or VW Jetta GLI is in order. For the same price as a Verano, you could put yourself into any number of larger, comparably equipped midsize sedans.","Aiming to build a miniature version of the popular LaCrosse sedan, Buick’s compact Verano for 2017 nearly hits the bull’s-eye. Unfortunately, lackluster sales have seen the Verano’s best bits axed this year, namely its turbocharged engine and 6-speed manual transmission. What’s left for consumers is still a competent little luxury cruiser comparable to the Acura ILX, Volkswagen Jetta and to a lesser degree, the Lexus CT 200h. Sharing its basic components with Chevy’s previous-generation Cruze may be one reason buyers didn’t bite, although Buick certainly added enough luxury bits and unique styling to avoid creating another Cadillac Cimarron. Time will tell if the Verano gets a do-over for 2018 or is permanently scratched from the roster.","It doesn’t take but a few moments behind the 2017 Buick Verano’s wheel to figure out this car was built for long-distance cruising and comfortable around-town errands.

QUIET CABIN
 Buick prides itself on a reputation for building ultra-quiet cabins and the 2017 Verano sedan is no exception. Using QuietTuning technology, Buick has successfully eliminated a good chunk of exterior noise and vibration that might otherwise creep into the Verano’s interior.
 
 4G WI-FI HOTSPOT
 Standard on even the base model, Buick’s OnStar 4G LTE includes a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot allowing users to connect compatible devices to the Internet where service is available (requires subscription).","","Buick’s 2017 Verano sedan is reduced to just three trim levels this year, and it loses the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and 6-speed manual-transmission option.; Park the 2017 Buick Verano next to the previous-generation","The 2017 Buick Verano comes standard with features that some of its competitors don't even offer as options. Base models get 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/USB sound system with 7-inch color touch screen, 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, dual-zone automatic climate control, tilt/telescopic steering column, cruise control and automatic headlights. It also comes standard with an electronic parking brake, remote start, Bluetooth and sound-deadening tricks like acoustic laminated glass to keep the interior quiet, a rarity for this price range. All Veranos include 10 airbags, stability/traction control, and automatic crash response as part of a 6-month trial of the OnStar communications system.","Optional Equipment 
Many desirable amenities for Buick’s 2017 Verano are bundled among its two other trims. The Sport Touring adds 18-inch wheels, heated seats, a power driver’s seat and rearview camera and rear parking sensors. The Leather Group brings leather seating, a heated steering wheel and a 9-speaker Bose premium audio system. Optional on both the Sport Touring and Leather Group is the Driver’s Confidence package that adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. The Leather Group’s Experience Package adds a power moonroof and the IntelliLink system with touch-screen navigation radio.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Buick Verano carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $22,000. Most will opt for the better-equipped Verano Sport Touring, which starts around $25,000. Prices go up as options are added until you reach a premium of around $30,000 for a fully loaded Leather Group model. Overall, the Buick Verano comfortably undercuts the rest of its niche market of entry-level luxury vehicles. An Acura ILX 4-door sedan, by comparison, starts closer to $29,000, while a base Lexus CT 200h is over $10,000 beyond the Buick's starting price. Be sure to check KBB's Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Verano. The downside is that the Verano's resale value isn't projected to be as good as the CT 200h, or even the ILX.

But, this hot little machine is anything but hype. Designed to take on the Audi A3, Acura ILX and Infiniti Q30, the 2017 CLA-Class can run circles around the competition, with standout styling and a high-performance AMG CLA45 version that pumps out an impressive 375 horsepower.

If you can live with the cramped rear seat and limited visibility, the 2017 MB CLA250 is ideal for first-time luxury-car buyers.","Generations of Mercedes-Benz cars have been pushed by their rear wheels, so the fact that the 2017 CLA250 4-door coupe is pulled by its front tires might seem like a...","Favorite Features 
 
PANORAMA ROOF
 The optional panoramic glass sunroof is a great way to open up the 2017 MB CLA-Class’s snug cabin. When open, the cockpit is filled with fresh air and sunshine. Leave the glass portion closed but with the sunshade retracted, and you’ll gain lots of light while creating a bit more headroom.
 
 AMG CLA45 4MATIC
 For those who can afford the premium, the AMG CLA45 4Matic delivers impressive power, handling and sophistication far better than any Acura ILX, Infiniti Q30 or Audi S3, but on par with the BMW M2.","As we've mentioned, the CLA-Class has a cramped rear seat and isn't the best choice if you regularly carry more than yourself and a passenger. But we wager this isn't a factor for most shoppers considering the CLA. And they'll find much to like in the front, where a standard 7-inch display, sturdy-looking air vents and a thick steering wheel give an air of elegance. A split-folding rear seat adds versatility to Mercedes' smallest sedan, while the two front seats offer more comfort with their adjustable cushion length. The standard MB-Tex faux leather seats do a good job mimicking genuine hide.","While it may look like Mercedes-Benz simply took its prettiest sedan -- the CLS that Mercedes also calls a “coupe” -- and left it in the dryer too long to create the CLA-Class, there's more to it. Still, the swooping architecture translates well to the smaller car, making it look longer and wider than it is, at least in isolation. However, the illusion breaks in traffic, when you notice how little of its lane it occupies. The low stance, narrow tires and clean shape give the CLA250 a slip-through-the-air drag coefficient of only 0.23. The new Night Package adds black 18-inch wheels.","Even the least expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan offers many standard features. Among them are dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 12-way-power driver's seat with memory and a brake-hold feature that applies the brake for you at stoplights. The CLA's infotainment system includes AM/FM/HD Radio with CD player, USB port and Bluetooth streaming, all seen and controlled by the 7-inch display and command dial. The CLA250 boasts impressive safety features including systems that detect driver drowsiness (Attention Assist), a rearview monitor and Active Brake Assist, which uses radar to warn the driver of a potential collision and, if necessary, even applies the brakes.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 CLA-Class offers a plethora of options, most bundled into packages. Most notable are navigation, harman/kardon premium audio, blind-spot monitoring, leather upholstery, heated front seats, smart cruise control, parallel-parking assist, panoramic sunroof, and adaptive suspension. AWD is optional on CLA250 models and standard on the AMG variant. That performance model can be further heightened with the AMG Dynamic Plus Package that raises the top speed to 167 mph, adds a Race Start setting and a limited-slip front differential. Mercedes' mbrace Connect service offers remote access from your phone. Five years' service is complimentary.","Under the Hood 
 
You have your choice of engines in Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sedan. The CLA250 gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 208 horsepower, available in either FWD or AWD. The CLA45 AMG version of that engine puts out an astonishing 375 horsepower to all four wheels. The AMG engine is the first 4-cylinder engine from Mercedes-Benz's in-house tuning branch. Both are mated to 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions. At up to 36 mpg, the CLA-Class can be remarkably fuel-efficient, but keep in mind this Mercedes requires premium gasoline.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (CLA250)

 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,000 rpm

 375 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm
 350 lb-ft of torque @ 2,250-5,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,400. Add AWD and you're looking at $2,000 more, and when you start adding option packages, this ""inexpensive"" Mercedes-Benz can easily swell toward $40,000. However, for around $37,000, you're looking at a lot of car with plenty of options. The CLA45 AMG starts considerably higher, around $51,000. However, even that is a bargain of sorts, since it's the least expensive AMG-badged model you can get. The Audi A3, a subcompact-luxury rival, starts slightly less than the Mercedes CLA-Class, while the Acura ILX is several thousand below. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's residual value is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.

If you’re a purist, assigning the term “coupe” to a 4-door sedan is simply marketing gone mad. If you need a functional high-performance sedan, a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series or even a Cadillac CT6 makes a better choice, as does the less expensive Genesis G90.","The “4-door coupe” concept was pioneered by Mercedes-Benz and in the 2017 CLS Coupe, the company executes the idea better than any other manufacturer. Available with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD), the 2017 CLS 4-door coupe is well equipped to take on rivals like the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe and the sleek Audi A7. Although the CLS’s aging design is holding up well, its usefulness as a sedan is somewhat hampered by a rather cramped rear seat and small trunk. Then again, those seeking a sense of exclusivity in a brilliant performance sedan will find the 2017 CLS63 AMG S and its 577 horsepower can certainly do the trick, that’s if the nearly $110,000 price tag isn’t a deterrent.","Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 CLS550 Coupe won’t win many fans of chauffeured travel, but if you’re lucky enough to be the one doing the driving, this car will put a smile on...","Favorite Features

 ELECTROMECHANICAL DIRECT-STEER SYSTEM
 If credit for the 2017 CLS’s impressive handling can be assigned to a specific component, the electromechanical direct-steer system would certainly be in the running. The system improves handling and, because it only draws power away from the engine when turning the wheels, saves on fuel as well.","","A new; For 2017, the","The CLS400 will use conventional steel springs for its suspension, with all other CLS models employing an adjustable air suspension.

Inside the CLS550, you’ll find a navigation system, 14-speaker harman/kardon sound system and many of the other amenities that are optional on the CLS400.

With the 2017 Jaguar XF, buyers can choose from two versions of a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine and one 4-cylinder 2.0-liter turbodiesel. The first V6 is a 340-horsepower version, available in Prestige, Premium and R Sport models. Opt for the XF S and you get the 380-horsepower version. Interestingly, torque figures for both engines are identical. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel offers nearly identical torque but with vastly better fuel economy and is available on the all but the S trim. All Jaguar XF models are available in all-wheel drive, and all route their power through an 8-speed automatic transmission that offers shift-for-yourself paddles on the steering wheel.

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the rear-wheel-drive 2017 Jaguar XF 20d starts at a reasonable-sounding $48,445 when you include the $995 destination charge. The base 6-cylinder car starts closer to $51,500. That's reasonable compared to 6-cylinder versions of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (around $54,000), BMW 5 Series (around $57,000) and Audi A6 (around $59,500). Of course, prices increase the higher up the ladder you climb, and if you opt for the quicker XF S with AWD, prices start at just below $66,700, and climb up from there. Still, that's in line with its competitors from Germany, Japan and the United States, and Jaguar has the best warranty of any of them. That's a nice pot sweetener, because resale value on Jaguars tends to lag behind its competitors.

If you’re seeking the peace of mind that comes from owning a Lexus, along with strong performance and exceptional levels of luxury and features, the 2017 Lexus GS luxury-sports sedans can accommodate just about any price point or aspiration. You can even opt for all-wheel drive (GS 350 only).","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Some luxury buyers may find the styling of the 2017 Lexus GS a bit too aggressive. With the exception of the GS F, the new GS line doesn’t feel quite as driver focused as a more sporting BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS, although it does offer a more comfortable ride.","As is expected of a Lexus sedan, the new 2017 GS is loaded with luxury and technology features, as well as superior long-term reliability and resale figures. Last year, the 4-door Lexus GS portfolio expanded to include the GS 200t 4-cylinder turbo and fire-breathing GS F sedan, which is powered by a 467-horsepower 5.0-liter V8. At the heart of the lineup are the V6-powered GS 350 and the more eco-friendly yet still fun-to-drive 2017 Lexus GS 450h hybrid. And to spice it up there’s an available F-Sport performance package on three of the four trim levels. When stacked up against the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS, the new GS proves a worthy competitor, offering similar levels of performance and technology.","After considerable time behind the wheel of a new Lexus GS 350 sedan, we found it to be a likable and competent performance sedan with impressive acceleration, cornering and braking...","Favorite Features 
 
LEXUS DRIVE MODE
 The Lexus Safety System+ package, introduced last year as an option, is now standard on the new GS 200t, GS 350 and GS 450h. The state-of-the-art system includes Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam (IHB) and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.
 
 HYBRID POWERTRAIN
 Who says performance and fuel economy can’t live in harmony? In the 2017 Lexus GS 450h, an Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V6 is teamed with an electric motor for a combined 338 horsepower. The combo delivers an impressive 31-mpg combined rating, yet accelerates the hybrid sedan faster than its gasoline-only counterpart.","","For 2017, the Lexus Safety System+ package, introduced last year as an option, is now standard on the new GS 200t, GS 350 and GS 450h. The state-of-the-art system includes Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam (IHB) and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.; Not for the shy, the new Lexus GS luxury performance sedan is a boldly styled piece of road-going art. It leads with an aggressive front-end treatment with an oversized grille, deep chin spoiler and intense expression. Distinctive headlights and LED taillights fit its sporting image, as do its muscular lines, highly defined shapes and low stance. The GS 350 and 450h are fitted with 18-inch alloy wheels, while the F Sport Package and GS F add 19-inch wheels. Rich and varied paint options are a pleasant departure from the ubiquitous sea of silver, white and black.","The Lexus Safety System+ package, introduced last year as an option, is now standard on the new GS 200t, GS 350 and GS 450h. The state-of-the-art system includes Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam (IHB) and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. All 2017 Lexus GS models include leather upholstery (NuLuxe simulated leather on the GS 200t), wood/metallic accent trim, power moonroof, multifunction steering wheel and energy-saving S-flow automatic climate control. The standard Lexus Premium Audio System has 12 speakers, AM/FM/DVD with HD Radio and WMA/MP3 capability, Bluetooth streaming, 5.1 Surround Sound and numerous other features.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Lexus GS with a Premium Package includes heated and ventilated front seats; a Luxury Package with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), rear audio and climate controls and semi-aniline leather upholstery; a Cold Weather Package with heated steering wheel; and the F Sport Package, which makes any Lexus more fun to drive. It adds a 16-way driver’s sport seat, custom-tuned AVS, bigger wheels, tires and brakes along with Variable Gear Ratio Steering. Stand-alone options include an HDD 12.3-inch Navigation system, power trunk release, an 835-watt, 17-speaker Mark Levinson premium surround-sound audio system and a Head-Up Display.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Lexus GS 200t starts just a shade over $47,000. The GS 350 starts closer to $51,500, with the AWD version starting closer to $52,500. The hybrid GS 450h starts just over $64,500 and adding numerous options can push it considerably higher. The GS F starts just over $85,000. The GS 350’s likely European competitors, the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, tend to have starting prices above that of the GS and are fairly close to each other in resale values, but the GS 350 is expected to maintain both 3-year and 5-year residuals that are higher, thus paying benefits in the long term. Before heading off to the dealer, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are actually paying for the 2017 Lexus GS 200t, 350 or 450h.

If you want a crossover SUV that's not too big, not too small and packs a lot for the money, the 2017 Sorento feels like Goldilocks. Kia's standard 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, meanwhile, could still be going strong when the kids are old enough to drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need a midsize SUV that can seat more than seven, try the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander. Something larger still like the Chevy Tahoe may be needed if you want a family vehicle that can tow a heavy trailer or offer additional room for gear.","The 2017 Kia Sorento midsize SUV packs value, good looks, a load of amenities and one of the best warranties in the business. Fresh off a revamp, this crossover SUV is available in 2-row/5-passenger form or the more versatile 3-row/7-passenger setup. With three engines to choose from and pricing that ranges from around $26,000 for a basic family vehicle to over $45,000 for a leather-lined quasi-luxury SUV, the Sorento fits a wide range of budgets and needs. Kia's midsize SUV is smaller than rivals like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer, making it less roomy but also easier to maneuver and park. The Sorento excels as a jack-of-all-trades, and continues to improve with enhancements such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.","Kia has worked feverishly to improve its cars on every level, and it only takes one drive in the Sorento to see that diligence has paid off. Compared to past...","Favorite Features 
 
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING
 Available on nearly every trim of the 2017 Sorento, this new safety feature does what humans can't: Keeps an unblinking eye on what's happening in front of you. Should the system sense an impending crash with no action on your part, it will apply the brakes to prevent a collision.
 
 SMART LIFTGATE
 Kia's Smart Liftgate makes it even easier to open the Sorento's optional power hatch when your hands are full. Instead of pushing a button on the SUV's key fob, you just stand near the rear for a few seconds with the fob in your pocket, and the liftgate opens.","The 2017 Sorento can be had with seating for five or seven. Whichever layout you prefer, this midsize SUV maintains Kia's reputation for interiors that feel more luxurious than you'd think, especially on Limited models with their softer leather. All models benefit from a contemporary dash and interior design. The front-row and 2nd-row seats are comfortable, but the third row is reserved for the smallest of adults and children. Cargo space behind the third row is limited, but fold the seats down and there's plenty of room for larger items. A hidden rear subfloor on lower-trim models increases usefulness.","Is this Sorento the best-looking SUV in its class? Maybe. We like the blunt nose, and Kia's ""tiger nose"" grille treatment looks exceptionally good here. The new-generation Sorento's added length goes a long way to reducing the stubbiness of the last-gen model, making this one look sleeker and more modern. Base and LX models get 17-inch alloy wheels, while EX models get 18-inchers, and SX roll on big 19-inchers, which are chrome on V6 Limited models. The LED fog lights and additional chrome on Limited models make for an upscale look. Roof rails come on all but the base L model.","The 2017 Sorento is available in four main trims, plus derivatives. As expected, the base L model is the bargain play, but it does include keyless entry, cruise control, stain-resistant cloth upholstery and basic AM/FM/CD audio system with Bluetooth connectivity and a USB input. We recommend at least stepping up to an LX model, which adds a rearview camera, sound-deadening windshield, touch-screen audio display, and the ability to add more amenities via packages and the option of all-wheel drive. The Sorento's safety features include airbags all around and a slew of traction and stability-control systems.","Optional Equipment 
We really like the mid-level EX trim's value. It grants Kia's UVO infotainment system with CarPlay and Android Auto, leather interior, rear park assist, push-button start, dual-zone climate control, 2nd-row window shades, power driver's seat, heated front seats and either a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine or V6. The top-line SX Limited comes loaded with what costs extra on other trims: blind-spot monitoring, panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, power liftgate, 8-inch touch screen with navigation, Infinity audio system and driving aids like lane-keep assist, smart cruise control and the new auto-braking feature. The SX Limited comes exclusively with Nappa leather trim.","Under the Hood 
 
Standard in L and LX models is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 185 horsepower, 178 lb-ft of torque, and the best fuel economy -- 28-mpg highway. The standard engine in EX and Limited Sorento SUVs is the new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. However, that engine is available only on 2-row models. Three-row EX and Limited models, and all SX models, come with the 3.3-liter V6 with 290 horsepower. A 6-speed automatic is the only transmission available. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on all models except the base L, which is front-wheel drive (FWD) only and features a locking center differential and Torque Vectoring Cornering Control. The Sorento can tow between 2,000 and 5,000 pounds, depending on engine and drive configuration.

At its least expensive, a 2017 Kia Sorento L starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $26,000 (including the $895 destination charge), but the $27,595 Sorento LX is worth the extra money thanks to additional features and available options, and that's still lower than many SUV competitors like the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer. A V6 Sorento starts just under $30,000, and the EX model with its turbocharged 4-cylinder is just over $32,000. At the top end, SX Limited models are nearly $45,000. Adding all-wheel drive is an extra $1,800 regardless of trim. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Kia. The Sorento's resale value is expected to be good, but still trail that of the Toyota Highlander.

If you’re looking for a 5-passenger luxury-crossover SUV with a proven record, stand-out styling and the latest in high-tech infotainment and safety features, the 2016 Cadillac SRX luxury SUV may be exactly what you’re looking for.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re all about aggressive handling and more aerodynamic styling, an Audi Q5 or Infiniti QX70 might be more to your liking. Those seeking better fuel economy might consider the Lexus RX hybrid or Mercedes-Benz GLK250 BlueTEC diesel.","With its angular good looks and hefty list of luxury features, Cadillac’s 2016 SRX crossover SUV makes no bones about appealing to a younger audience. Being the final year for this body style, the 2016 SRX departs still being competitive against such lofty challengers as the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Mercedes-Benz GLK. The German brands may deliver more spirited driving experiences, but the SRX won’t disappoint, and its ride is more in line with what most buyers expect of a luxury-crossover SUV. A powerful V6 ensures impressive performance, while a roomy interior allows everyone plenty of head- and legroom. Combine all this with the SRX’s technology-rich CUE touch-screen infotainment system, and it becomes clear why an aging SRX remains relevant.","Our 2016 Cadillac SRX test drive included equal time on winding back roads and long freeway expanses, and we found both equally suited to the SRX’s abilities. Though it tips...","Favorite Features 
 
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING 
The SRX’s automatic emergency braking setup can detect an impending low-speed collision and warn the driver. Should the driver fail to respond in time, the system will intervene and bring the car to a complete stop. 
 
BOSE SILENCE AND SOUND 
Cadillac’s SRX luxury SUV for 2016 includes a marvelous Bose audio system with Active Noise Cancellation. This system quiets the cabin by using opposing sound waves to cancel out intrusive road and wind noise.","","For 2016, every; “Athletic” and “attractive” are just two ways to describe Cadillac's crossover SUV. The SRX's sense of style is highlighted by angular sheet metal and a stylish – but visibility-hampering – sloped roof. Prominent creases rise along the sides from just aft the front wheels to below the rear windows, conveying a sense of momentum. The power liftgate – standard on all but base models – is an arm-saver. Twin tailpipes and large, 18- or 20-inch wheels round out a package well-suited for a young executive.","In base form, Cadillac’s 2016 SRX luxury-crossover SUV includes an 8-speaker Bose sound system with dual USB inputs and Bluetooth streaming, and dual-zone auto climate control. Leatherette is the upholstery in base models. Stepping up to the Luxury trim adds a few thousand to the price, but brings real leather, a panoramic sunroof, a power liftgate, a rearview camera, keyless access and blind-spot monitoring, which is a big help on crowded roads. The top-end Premium trim adds 10-speaker Bose audio, navigation, a ventilated driver's seat to keep you cool, and safety features like lane-departure warning.","Optional Equipment 
All-wheel drive can be had on all but base models of the 2016 Cadillac SRX luxury-crossover SUV. Other options vary by trim. Among them are the Driver Assist Package that includes the automatic braking feature and adaptive cruise control. Other features of note include a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system with wireless headphones, Safety Seat Alert (it alerts the driver to a potential collision by vibrating the seat), and a pet cargo partition to accommodate Fido.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Cadillac SRX has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $38,600 and can reach over $50,000 for a loaded model. The SRX's base price slightly undercuts the starting prices of the BMX X3, Lexus RX and Lincoln MKX, and is above those of the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are actually paying for their SRX.

If you prefer your luxury SUVs to be brilliant performance machines, the MKX probably won’t satisfy in the same way a BMW X5 M or Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC43 can.

Instead, the MKX provides a more personal mode of transportation, one backed by an available 335-horsepower EcoBoost engine and numerous premium luxury touches such as the 22-way-adjustable front seats and Revel 19-speaker audio system.","If you want to experience the 2017 Lincoln MKX at its best, you’ll need to order it with the 335-horsepower turbocharged V6 EcoBoost engine.

ECOBOOST ENGINE
 Lincoln’s 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 delivers more horsepower and torque than the standard 3.7-liter V6 with no penalty in fuel economy. The extra power is on tap at all times, helping this rather hefty SUV feel lighter than it actually is.
 
 22-WAY POWER-ADJUSTABLE MASSAGING SEATS
 Luxury is supposed to be about extravagance, so the fact that the 2017 Lincoln MKX offers a set of 22-way-power-adjustable seats just seems fitting. Need more? How about the ability to heat or cool their occupants, and even massage fatigued leg and back muscles.","","Fresh from its debut last year, the Lincoln’s MKX SUV sails into 2017 with no major changes.; The overall shape of Lincoln’s 2017 MKX luxury SUV is similar to that of its kin the Ford Edge, but there are some styling cues that separate the two. The MKX uses Lincoln's split grille, plus generous use of LED lighting. The MKX comes standard with 18-inch wheels, which can be upped to 20- or 21-inch wheels with Lincoln's top-of-the-line Black Label. In addition to a choice of interior themes, it adds exclusive paint colors and badges to the MKX's exterior.","Included in the base price of the Lincoln MKX (Premiere trim) are cool features like LED taillights and a reverse-sensing system, plus heated side mirrors. Also heated is the standard 10-way-power driver seat. A media hub is included, as are Sync 3, a 9-speaker audio system and a rearview camera. Other standard niceties include a particulate air-filtration system, remote start, torque-vectoring control and curve control.","Optional Equipment 
Where the Lincoln MKX really shines is in the options. The torquey EcoBoost engine. Revel audio systems, with up to 19 speakers. The huge Panoramic Vista Roof. Front seats that aren't just heated and cooled, but also are 22-way-adjustable and have seat massagers. Voice-activated navigation. Then there's the Lincoln Black Label, a trim level that's treated like an exclusive membership. You get a liaison that helps you throughout the purchase of an MKX, complimentary car washes anytime and a free annual detailing, vehicle pickup and drop-off for service and access to the Culinary Experience at restaurants with acclaimed chefs.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Lincoln MKX has a starting Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just shy of $39,200 for the front-drive Premiere with the 3.7-liter V6. Move up to the Select trim and the price begins just under $42,500, while the Reserve's starting-off point comes in right around $46,500. The top-of-the-line Black Label starts at over $54,000, and can top out over $67,000. Opting for the EcoBoost engine adds $2,000 no matter what trim. The 2017 MKX's base price is higher than the Acura RDX, on par with the Cadillac XT5, but below the Volvo XC60, Lexus RX and Audi Q5. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Historically, we've found resale values for the Lincoln MKX to be on the average side for the class.

Reasons to buy a Touareg in light of far better rivals are few. But this VW does offer some premium appeal and active safety features even in its base model, and there's no arguing that it is ruggedly handsome and offers confident traction on snow and dirt thanks to its full-time all-wheel-drive system.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Touareg offers only one engine, and its $50,000-plus starting price is hardly a value. You can do far better in everything ranging from a Ford Edge or Lincoln MKX to a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX or Mercedes-Benz GLE.","The 2017 Volkswagen Touareg is the German brand's flagship SUV, but its $50,000 starting price makes it as awkward a fit in its segment as its name is to pronounce (try ""tour-egg""). Ostensibly this 5-passenger SUV is more luxurious than a Ford Edge or Jeep Grand Cherokee but not quite as fancy as a BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE or even its cousins the Audi Q5 and Q7, and Porsche Cayenne. In reality, we'd recommend just about any competitor over the Touareg. This VW SUV has much going against it beyond a high price and aging platform. The Touareg's brightest aspect -- a strong and efficient diesel engine -- is gone due to VW's emissions-cheating scandal, leaving a tired and overburdened V6 as its only motivation.","The Touareg has gone from potentially stout and enjoyable to feeling tired. This is due to the discontinuation of the diesel V6 engine option. That leaves only a 280-horsepower gasoline...","Favorite Features 
 
AREA VIEW MONITOR
 If large SUVs have a common issue it is the lack of outward visibility below the window line. Available in top-trim Executive models, VW remedies this situation by strategically mounting four cameras outside the Touareg, projecting for the driver a 360-degree view onto a color view screen.
 
 10-YEAR/100,000-MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY
 In an effort to turn the tide on years of perceived VW reliability issues, the company now offers a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty on every 2017 VW Touareg, although the comprehensive bumper-to-bumper warranty still only covers three years/36,000 miles.","","A year after the; The Touareg remains a handsome SUV with a muscled, squat appearance. All models feature bright bi-xenon headlights, while chrome roof rails add to this sport-utility vehicle's utility. Wolfsburg and Executive models have a panoramic sunroof, and all feature a power tailgate. The Touareg has a decent ground clearance of 7.9 inches, but that's still shy of a Jeep Grand Cherokee and even a","With this year's trim shuffle, the Touareg now goes like this: Sport w/Technology, Wolfsburg and Executive. The base Sport w/Technology model adds quite a few features this year, but it also comes with a several-thousand-dollar price increase. Now standard is a suite of safety and driving aids like adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and a blind-spot monitor, which VW calls Lane Change Assistant. Also included are automatic climate control, hands-free power liftgate, heated and ventilated front seats and heated steering wheel, and 8-inch infotainment system with navigation, rearview camera and 8-speaker audio system.","Optional Equipment 
Stepping up to the Wolfsburg Touareg adds a panoramic sunroof and leather seating, 14-way-adjustable front seats, power rear-folding seat release, front-center armrest/console and rear-seat vents. The topline Executive model includes the overhead-view camera system, driver's memory-seat position, 10-speaker Dynaudio premium audio system and 21-inch wheels. Other options are pretty much limited to accessories.","Pricing Notes 
 
With the Touareg's increased standard content for 2017 comes an increased price. Where last year's model started around $43,600, the 2017 Touareg begins with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $50,405, which includes destination. Mid-trim Wolfsburg models go for $53,705, while the Executive edition is $61,105. At these prices we instead recommend less expensive rivals such as the Ford Edge or its upscale sibling the Lincoln MKX, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Audi Q5 or the Lexus RX. Even luxury SUV rivals like the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE aren't far off the Touareg's starting price. If you're still married to the idea of a Touareg, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. Yet another mark against the Touareg is resale value, which isn't predicted to hold up well in the years to come.

 SPORTY PERFORMANCE
 SUVs are not usually associated with performance driving manners, but the Infiniti QX70 is among those that blend just that with the higher seating position and cargo-carrying practicality for which SUVs are known.","","Only slight updates are in store for the aging Infiniti QX70. Among them are a revised grille design, two new exterior colors (Hagane Blue and Majestic White), and the new Limited Package that replaces the former Deluxe Touring Package.; The QX70's sophisticated suit backs up its performance intentions. Big, wide, brawny yet elegantly curvaceous, Infiniti's brawler still stands out even among a sea of SUVs suddenly vying to be performance vehicles. The QX70 continues to be distinguished by its sports-car-like long hood, side air vents just aft the front wheels, raked roof and twin exhaust outlets. Aluminum roof racks included in the recommended Premium package grant an extra dose of utility. Standard wheels are 18 inches, with more substantial 21s available.","The Infiniti QX70 crossover SUV is dressed well even in base form. Standard features include leather interior, power tailgate, power-operated and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, 11-speaker Bose AM/FM/SiriusXM/CD audio system with USB port, rearview camera and 7-inch color central display.","Optional Equipment 
The QX70's options list is refreshingly short. Aside from opting for all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD), most options are bundled into four packages. The Premium package includes navigation, AroundView bird's-eye camera system, Bluetooth audio streaming, power-adjustable steering wheel with entry/exit assist, and roof rails. A Sport package adds paddle shifters, interior accents, 21-inch wheels and climate-controlled front seats, while the Limited package has dark exterior finishes, unique front bumper, wood interior accents and more. The Technology package bundles adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning and lane-departure prevention. Surprisingly, blind-spot monitoring isn't offered on the QX70.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Infiniti QX70 luxury-crossover SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at just under $47,000 with rear-wheel drive, while the traction-enhancing AWD version costs an additional $1,800. Fully loaded, the QX70 barely touches $60,000. Competitors like the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe, BMW X6 and Porsche Cayenne cost significantly more, further strengthening the Infiniti's value proposition.

If you need lots of cargo space behind the 3rd-row seat or need to tow serious loads, a full-size SUV like the Chevy Tahoe or Nissan Armada makes a better choice. Those looking for base-model pricing with advanced driver-assist features will need to look to the Toyota Highlander.","Honda’s venerable Pilot SUV for 2017 provides 3-row convenience in a vehicle noted for its reliability and strong resale. This 3rd-generation Pilot is slightly smaller than the last, but the design is sleeker and more upscale. The Pilot sacrifices some interior room to the design, making it smaller inside than the aging Chevrolet Traverse, but still slightly larger than the current Ford Explorer. The 2017 Pilot is also up to speed on the latest safety features, offering driver-assist systems like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and crash-detection and mitigation. On the road, the Pilot is every bit the equal of the Toyota Highlander and Nissan Pathfinder, although it can’t match the off-road prowess of a Ford Explorer or Land Rover Discovery.","It doesn’t take long behind the wheel of Honda’s 2017 Pilot SUV to determine this might just be the best-riding, best-handling 3-row family transport under $40,000.

 UNDER-FLOOR STORAGE
 You’ll like what Honda has done to improve storage without impinging on passenger comfort. The hidden cargo area behind the third seat adds about three cubic feet of storage and has a sturdy reversible cover carpeted on one side that conveniently stows away at the bottom of the cargo well.","","After a complete redo last year, the 2017 Honda Pilot SUV sees only minor changes. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are made standard on EX trims and higher, while the black interior option is now offered on all trims wearing White Diamond Pearl paint.; The 2017 Honda Pilot shuns the first two generations’ boxy styling in favor of sleek lines that are clearly designed to evoke a family resemblance to the smaller CR-V and HR-V. While it no longer stands out in a parking lot, the current Pilot SUV looks better overall. We particularly like the LED accents in the headlights, and a taillight design that reflects the same pattern. However, some may find the cargo floor is a couple inches higher than need be, while other will lament the glass on the rear hatch no longer opens independently of the hatch itself.","The basic front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2017 Honda Pilot LX comes standard with a multi-angle rearview camera and a tire-pressure-monitoring system that flashes the lights when you've filled a tire to its proper pressure. Cruise control, audio and phone controls are all located on the steering wheel, and all Pilots come with Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch information screen between the gauges, push-button start, and an Eco mode to help fuel economy. Still, it's worth upgrading to at least the EX model, which adds Honda's Intelligent Traction Management system, an upgraded audio system that includes HondaLink, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Honda's clever LaneWatch right-side-view camera.","Optional Equipment 
The new Honda Pilot breaks most of its options into different models. For example, if you want things like dynamic guidelines on your rearview camera, you'll have to step up to the EX model. If you want leather, you're in EX-L territory. The 9-speed automatic is standard once you get to Touring and Elite models. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on all models, except for Elite, where it's standard. Also available on all new Honda Pilot models (besides LX) is the Honda Sensing suite of collision and road-departure mitigation and warning, lane-departure warning, active cruise and lane-keeping assist.","Pricing Notes 
 
A base FWD 2017 Pilot LX carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $31,500 including the $900 destination charge. The much nicer EX and EX-L grades start a few thousand higher, at $33,900 and $37,400, respectively. Touring models start at about $42,500. Adding the Honda Sensing system to any model increases the cost by $1,000. Add $1,800 if you want AWD. The top-line 2017 Honda Pilot Elite model tops out at about $48,000. Overall, Honda’s Pilot SUV for 2017 is priced competitively against the Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and be comfortable knowing that over the years your Honda Pilot will hold its value better than the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder, Dodge Durango and Chevrolet Traverse.

If you want an SUV with luxury-badge appeal and the ability to crawl over some of the world's roughest terrain, the Land Rover LR4 is a worthy descendant of a brand whose name is synonymous with excursion. Starting at roughly $50,000, this luxurious capability is also relatively attainable.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Let's be honest: Will you ever venture farther off-road than a dirt parking lot or traverse an obstacle trickier than a mall speed bump? If not, a luxury- crossover SUV like the Acura MDX or Volvo XC90 will offer better fuel economy, more features and a plusher ride.","The 2016 Land Rover LR4 is a rolling ode to the legendary British brand itself. Tough on the outside, plush within, and capable of venturing farther off-road than most owners could ever dream. It's among a handful of rugged, body-on-frame luxury SUVs that remain, joining other holdouts such as the Lexus GX. Even within Land Rover's evolving lineup, the LR4 stands apart with its blocky looks. This is all good news if you want a 5- or 7-passenger premium SUV with a tough attitude and the chops to back it up. But the LR4's off-road prowess comes at the cost of ride quality, efficiency and everyday practicality. In those respects, rivals like the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60 and Audi Q7 have the upper hand.","For such a tall and rugged SUV built on a truck-like body-on-frame chassis, the 2016 Land Rover LR4 is more comfortable and stable than you may expect. Suspension engineers can...","Favorite Features 
 
COMMANDING VIEW 
Whether you're snaking your way down a narrow trail or slogging it out in the urban jungle, the 2016 LR4 puts you in a commanding driving position. The British luxury SUV's tall stature and the high driver's seat, along with large window designs, enable you to see up, over and around. 
 
4-CORNER AIR SUSPENSION 
One of the 2016 Land Rover LR4 SUV’s best features is its adjustable air suspension. With just a push of a button the LR4 can raise itself to clear treacherous obstacles, or lower itself to allow easy entry for passengers and cargo.","","Aside from a new paint color (Waitomo Grey) and minor upgrades to its infotainment system, the Land Rover LR4 SUV remains largely unchanged for 2016.; The LR4 is like a modern twist on a classic Land Rover. Even as the rest of the Land Rover/Range Rover line evolves into more rounded, organic shapes, the LR4 retains its tough, blocky profile. Whatever it lacks in aerodynamics, this luxury SUV makes up for in space within. The LR4's large windows provide a better view out, and its asymmetrical tailgate is distinctive and useful. The downside is that it's not power-operated. We're also fans of the ""Alpine Roof"" – a power glass sunroof over the front seats and glass panels over the rear seats.","The 2016 LR4 remains available in a trio of trims: Base, HSE and HSE LUX. Base models include leather interior, power front seats, dual-zone climate control, rearview camera with parking aid plus Land Rover's bevy of off-road hardware and software. The infotainment system is centered around a 7-inch touch screen and includes an 11-speaker/380-watt Meridian audio system. HSE models add 7-passenger seating as standard, xenon headlights, navigation and keyless entry. HSE LUX LR4 models have a 17-speaker/825-watt audio system, upgraded leather seating and the Climate Comfort Package that bundles heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, and heated windscreen.","Optional Equipment 
Blind-spot monitoring is available on the LR4 and always a welcome safety feature. Also on hand is a 5-camera system that relays a surround view of your LR4, letting you see where your eyes can’t. Other extras include a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and adaptive cruise control with forward-collision alert and mitigation braking. Those who plan to do serious off-roading should consider the Heavy Duty Package that includes a locking rear differential, low range for the transfer case and a full-size spare tire. The Tow Package enables the LR4 to pull up to 7,716 pounds.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Land Rover LR4 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $51,000. The mid-level HSE trim starts just over $56,000, while the top-line HSE LUX begins over $61,500. Options can increase these prices by several thousand. At its starting price, the Land Rover is several thousand more than the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60 and Audi Q7, and is in line with the all-new Volvo XC90, Lexus GX and Mercedes-Benz GLE. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new LR4. Regarding resale value, Land Rovers have notoriously seen steep depreciation, but in recent years their values have held up better. Still, don't expect Lexus-like residuals when it comes time to sell.

If you’re looking for a large, comfortable luxury-crossover SUV with a proven record, an adult-friendly 3rd-row seat and a comfortable ride, the 8-passenger 2017 Buick Enclave deserves a test drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Buick’s 2017 Enclave SUV doesn’t offer the latest safety technologies, so if you’re looking for adaptive cruise control, autonomous braking or the ability to self-steer under certain conditions, you’ll have to go with another brand.","Buick’s family-friendly Enclave luxury SUV for 2017 has a lot going for it. Its aging platform remains strong, offering generous accommodations in all three rows and a large cargo area behind the 3rd-row seat. The Enclave’s luxury credentials nearly rival such high-end competitors as the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60, although the Enclave lacks the Audi Q7’s supercharged engine option. However, the 2017 Buick Enclave SUV has a solid price advantage over many of its luxury rivals and a pretty solid resale and reliability record, too. The Enclave delivers one of the most comfortable rides in this class, but in the areas of fuel economy and the latest safety technologies, the Enclave is falling far behind newer SUVs such as the Mazda CX-9.","Driving the 2017 Buick Enclave luxury-crossover SUV reminds us of what Buick does so well.

INTERIOR VERSATILITY
 Buick’s Enclave SUV for 2017 not only seats up to eight passengers, its brilliantly engineered 2nd-row seats can flip and fold with one-handed operation. The seats also slide forward to create easy access to the third row. Folding both rows creates a cavernous cargo hold.
 
 QuietTuning
 Although it may sound like a fancy word for “extra padding,” Buick’s QuietTuning technology actually goes much further. Triple door seals, acoustic laminated glass and unique suspension tuning all work to quiet the Enclave’s plush interior.","","For 2017, Buick’s Enclave SUV gets the Sport Touring treatment. Like other Buicks wearing the ST badge, the Enclave version is mechanically identical to other trims, offering only cosmetic upgrades such as Satin Black grille and accents, plus 20-inch chrome wheels.; The 2017 Buick Enclave is larger than most of its 3-row crossover-SUV rivals. At nearly 202 inches it has significant road presence. The Buick's exterior lines are rounded and handsome overall, though not everyone will favor its hump-like rear. Among the more favorable design cues are Buick's elegant ""waterfall"" grille in front and big, oblong exhaust outlets at rear. Standard roof-mounted luggage racks add a degree of ruggedness with their practicality and an available power moonroof with fixed sunlight for rear passengers helps bring the outdoors inside. One of the Enclave's most useful features is its standard power-operated liftgate.","Even in base form (Convenience), Buick’s full-size crossover SUV offers significant value. Included are tri-zone climate control, power-adjustable front seats, a rearview camera with park assist, high-intensity headlights, and an AM/FM/CD/USB audio system with a 6.5-inch touch screen and Buick's IntelliLink system to connect smartphones and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity with built-in Wi-Fi hotspot (subscription required after trial). Mid-trim Leather Group models add the leather, heated front seats and steering wheel, and blind-spot monitoring. Top-line Premium models have heated and cooled front seats, 10-speaker Bose audio and a forward-collision warning system. New Buicks also include two years/24,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.","Optional Equipment 
Traction-enhancing all-wheel drive (AWD) -- always a good option for an SUV that may be used in adverse weather conditions -- can be had on the two higher trims of the 2017 Buick Enclave instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD). Other upgrades vary by trim and include a Bose premium sound system with navigation, forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones, a power moonroof with rear skylight, and 19- and 20-inch wheel options. The new Sport Touring with Black Satin accents is available on Enclaves dressed in the higher Leather and Premium trims.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Buick Enclave has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $40,000 for the base Convenience trim. Opting for a higher trim, such as the Leather Group, adds many desirable features and starts at a still-digestible $44,700. The top-line Premium Group arrives at $48,550. AWD costs $2,000. Fully loaded, an Enclave SUV can reach the mid-$50,000 range. The Enclave is slightly less expensive than the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60, which start in the mid-$40,000 range, while the Audi Q7 begins over $55,000, and the new Volvo XC90 and Lexus GX 460 are around $45,000 and $50,000, respectively. The BMW X5 begins in the mid-$50,000 range. To get the best deal, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Enclave is expected to have average resale value in the years ahead, but has been tops in its segment for total 5-year cost-to-own.

The XT5 is a standout in the compact-luxury crossover SUV segment, with crisp, angular styling and a suite of features not offered on other SUVs in its class. It also offers a spacious cabin, with more rear-seat legroom than the benchmark Lexus RX.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Cadillac's new crossover SUV doesn’t offer 3-row seating. For that, consider the Audi Q7, Acura MDX or Cadillac Escalade. Also, there are no optional engines -- meaning no high-performance variants, hybrids or diesels. The Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Porsche Macan are tempting alternatives.","2017 marks the first year of the XT5, a 2-row luxury crossover SUV that replaces the Cadillac SRX. While its styling is reminiscent of the previous model, this all-new vehicle is on a new platform, allowing Cadillac to start with a clean sheet of paper compared to the long-in-the-tooth SRX. The XT5 is more powerful -- thanks to a new engine and the SUV's weight loss -- and the cabin is notably more posh, quieter and roomier, with new high-tech and luxe features. The XT5 doesn't feel quick, as its transmission seems to be biased toward fuel efficiency, but that pays off in greatly improved fuel economy (which it needed). The XT5 is prepared to compete with the Lexus RX, Audi Q5 and BMW X3.","Our time behind the wheel of the XT5 was split among jaunts on long, gently curving roads, time in city traffic and some stretches through twisty canyons. The combination of...","Favorite Features 
 
REAR CAMERA MIRROR
 With the push of a button, the entire frame of the rearview mirror is filled with what's essentially a live broadcast of what is going on behind the XT5. This gives you a constant, high-resolution view of traffic without headrests or the roofline getting in the way.
 
 SPORT MODE
 For a combo that'll let you make the absolute most of your time driving a twisty road, put the XT5 in Sport mode. This delays transmission shifts, changes the steering effort, biases torque to the rear (in all-wheel-drive models) and modifies the suspension calibration.","The cabin of Cadillac's XT5 is noticeably quieter and more elegant than that of the SRX it replaces. The quality of the materials -- including carbon fiber, aluminum and real open-pore wood -- and the fit and finish are excellent. That, plus the roomy, sliding second row and tasteful color schemes ensure the interior holds its own against the competition. It's also wonderfully quiet inside. Setting it apart are the availability of Apple CarPlay, an improved version of Cue, a color head-up display and the terrific gotta-try-it-to-appreciate-it Rear Camera Mirror.","The XT5 reflects the ongoing evolution of Cadillac's Art and Science design philosophy. Despite a strong family resemblance to the SRX, the XT5 weighs nearly 300 pounds less, is on a new platform and is tighter, tauter and stronger. That tautness was a theme in the XT5's exterior design, where body lines are crisper and the nose uses a new jeweled headlight design. The XT5 has a 2-inch-longer wheelbase with short front and rear overhangs, giving it sportier proportions. The trim level that's visually set apart from the rest is the new top-of-the-line Platinum, with its unique exhaust, 20-inch wheels and grille.","All XT5s come with cruise control, electric parking brake, power front seats, remote-controlled power express up/down windows, 18-inch wheels and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Internet connectivity, 4G LTE with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, comes with the XT5, as do CUE connectivity, Apple CarPlay, 8-speaker Bose audio and a wireless smartphone charging pad. Also standard are a rear-view camera and dual front, front and rear head-curtain and driver’s-knee airbags. While a navigation system isn’t standard, one year of OnStar is, which can provide turn-by-turn directions. Also not standard: a limited-use spare tire.","Optional Equipment 
In addition to the base XT5, trim levels for Cadillac's compact-luxury midsize crossover SUV include Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum. Driver-assist options include adaptive cruise control, automatic park assist, automatic front braking, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist and a safety seat that lets the driver know when there is a potentially dangerous situation. Tri-zone climate control is available, as are an UltraView sunroof, ventilated seats, head-up display, hands-free power liftgate and DVD rear-seat entertainment.","Under the Hood 
 
Available in either front-wheel or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), Cadillac’s new XT5 boasts a 3.6-liter V6 like the SRX, but this engine is all-new, with features such as variable valve timing, Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation, direct injection and auto stop/start technology. This V6 uses a new 8-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. The XT5's new twin-clutch AWD system is optional.
 
 3.6-liter V6
 310 horsepower @ 6,700 rpm
 271 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (FWD), 18/26 mpg (AWD)","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Cadillac XT5 starts at $39,990 with front drive. The top-line Platinum starts at about $63,000, and with a few option packages, climbs to above $70,000. That pricing falls in line with that of its competitors, but keep in mind that in many cases, those top-line models are diesels or hybrids, such as the Lexus RX 450h, options that aren't offered in the XT5.

If you’re looking for a family SUV with advanced electronics and safety features, plus a wide range of engines and option choices, Ford’s midsize SUV for 2017 is hard to beat. The Explorer’s advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system makes it more off-road capable than a Honda Pilot or Mazda CX-9.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for something that’s easy to maneuver and park, and you don’t need a 3rd-row seat, a smaller SUV like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano or Jeep Grand Cherokee makes a better choice. The Jeep also bests the Explorer both off-road and in towing (7,800 pounds vs. 5,000).","Ford’s 2017 Explorer SUV continues its sales success, with sleek styling, a bevy of trim and package options, and a choice of potent powertrains. The 7-passenger Ford Explorer has plenty of competition, but its Land Rover-like styling and incredibly plush interior place it in line with upscale competitors like the Mazda CX-9 and Hyundai Santa Fe. From the Platinum trim’s twin-turbocharged V6 to the Sport’s beefy wheel and tire package, the 2017 Ford Explorer is one crossover SUV with multiple personalities. Even the most inexpensive base model offers a high-tech 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine, while the available Terrain Management System allows the Explorer to live up to its name both on- and off-road.","When it comes to horsepower, Ford’s 7-passenger Explorer SUV for 2017 delivers at every level. From the standard 290-horsepower V6 to the fuel-efficient 280-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder available in the base,...","Favorite Features 
 
BUTTONS
 With more and more SUVs moving to touch-screen-only interfaces, it’s rather refreshing to see sometimes the old ways are still the best ways. Sure, the 2017 Ford Explorer features a big 8-inch touch screen, but it also has easy-to-reach and -operate controls for the climate and audio.
 
 TERRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 Because Ford’s 2017 Explorer is a crossover SUV, it lacks the rugged body-on-frame design once common to off-road SUVs. To compensate, Ford’s Terrain Management System offers varying settings for the AWD system including snow, sand, mud, grass and gravel.","","With the exception of a new Sport Appearance package for the XLT trim, the 2017 Ford Explorer SUV carries over unchanged.; Last year’s upgrades didn’t alter the Explorer’s basic silhouette, but the details are quite nice. The standard LED low-beam headlights, grille and bumper in front give this mainstream SUV a first-glance resemblance to a","The 2017 Ford Explorer SUV comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport and Platinum. Base models come standard with the 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford's Sync. Ford's MyKey allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.","Optional Equipment 
As is often the case these days, moving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base, XLT and Limited models can substitute the 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder for the standard V6, and AWD is available across the board, regardless of engine. The Platinum model comes with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6, plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash and other luxury items.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Ford Explorer starts around $32,000 for a FWD base model with the standard V6 engine. The 2.3-liter 4-cylinder adds $495 to that total, while the AWD system tacks on $2,200. We think the XLT is a better entry point, at its base price of about $35,000. If you're looking for more power, the AWD Sport and Platinum models start at $46,000 and $54,000, respectively. That's competitive with the Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot, although the Hyundai Santa Fe starts just a few hundred dollars south of $32,000. The KBB.com Fair Purchase Price helps you get a good deal by telling you what other Explorer buyers in your area paid. Note that the Explorer's resale value holds up better than the Dodge Durango, and is right in line with the Chevrolet Traverse and Pilot, even if it's less than the Highlander.

Buyers in the market for a slick-looking, smooth-driving 3-row SUV with sophisticated character and all of the latest driver-assist tech should seriously consider checking out the all-new 2017 Acadia.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for a midsize SUV with maximum toting/towing capabilities, the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander all offer more of both. And for those who think bigger really is better but still favor the GMC brand, the full-size Yukon may be the best choice of all.","Redesigned from the ground up, the 2017 GMC Acadia boasts a sleeker look, enhanced technology and greater efficiency in a slightly smaller and significantly lighter package that “strategically repositions” this midsize SUV to further separate it from GMC’s full-size Yukon. Based on all-new platform architecture that also underpins the new Cadillac XT5, the recast Gen II Acadia still has 3-row seating for up to seven and generous cargo space but packs it into a more maneuverable and driver-friendly configuration. As part of its comprehensive recasting, the 2017 Acadia also gains a host of new assist systems and now offers a new 4-cylinder engine choice as well as its traditional V6, front-drive or a sophisticated 4-wheel drive system and a new off-road-focused All-Terrain variant.","A smaller footprint and significant weight drop impart a new level of dynamic appeal to the remade Acadia in every configuration. Its measured rescaling to true midsize status trims the...","Favorite Features 
 
DRIVE MODE SELECTOR
 A new feature on all Acadias, the Drive Mode Selector offers a choice of settings to optimize the powertrain and suspension response under all conditions, including a dedicated Trailer/Tow mode. The on-demand AWD system also features a fuel-saving 2x4 with positive AWD disconnect while All-Terrain models replace the Off-Road mode with an All-Terrain setting.
 
 ALL-TERRAIN MODEL
 The new Acadia All-Terrain matches V6 power with a bespoke Active Twin Clutch all-wheel-drive system that enhances traction on all surfaces and improves uphill climbing capability. The 5-passenger All-Terrain also features Hill Descent Control and swaps its 3rd-row seats for covered rear storage bins and a cargo management system.","Although its absolute scale has been trimmed a bit, the 2017 Acadia SUV’s cabin boasts an even more upscale character helped by a modern design that includes additional soft-touch surfaces, upgraded trim and active noise cancellation. Despite a wheelbase that now matches the compact 5-passenger GMC Terrain, the Acadia’s new architecture still allows for three adult-accommodating rows of seats. The second tier -- 60-40 bench or Captain’s Chairs -- features an upgraded Smart Slide system for easier access to the 50/50 third row and both fold flat to expand the fairly modest 12.8 cu. ft. of base cargo space to a quite usable 79.0 cu. ft. maximum.","The Acadia remake introduces a more sophisticated but still substantial look that’s skewed more towards contemporary","Even the base Acadia SL comes with tri-zone auto climate control, numerous power assists, a 7.0-inch Color Touch Screen, Keyless Open and Start, 5-year OnStar Basic Plan, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, five USB ports and the industry’s first rear-seat reminder safety alert system to prevent leaving kids or other valuables from being left behind. Moving up through the SLE/SLT ranks introduces everything from a power liftgate, 8.0-inch touchscreen with IntelliLink and SiriusXM Satellite Radio to leather upholstery, Bose audio and Navigation. The Denali and All-Terrain add distinctive cosmetic/convenience touches plus a full range of new driver assists.","Optional Equipment 
The Acadia’s extras roster relates to its trim grade, with no AWD available on the entry-level SL. But the SLE-1 can be had with that and a rear-seat entertainment system while the SLE-2 offers Bose sound, upgraded infotainment choices and the Dual SkySkape 2-panel panoramic sunroof. It also offers a new Driver Alert Package I that brings Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Rear Park Assist, all of which are found in the Denali’s more comprehensive -- and standard -- Driver Alert Package II that adds Pedestrian Detection and Forward Collision Alert with Low-Speed Automatic Braking.","Under the Hood 
 
The Acadia offers two new naturally aspirated engines, both backed by a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic. Sole motivator in the base front-wheel-drive-only SL and standard in the SLE-1/SLE-2/SLT-1 models, the new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder makes 194 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The first GMC engine to feature Start-Stop technology, it earns GM-estimated 21/26-mpg EPA City/Highway marks in front-wheel drive (FWD) Acadia models and 21/25 in AWD variants. The new 3.6-liter V6 standard in all other Acadias makes a considerably stouter 310 horses and 271 lb-ft of torque but features Active Fuel Management that turns it into a V4 under light loads. It nets GM-estimated 18/25 mpg EPA numbers in both FWD and AWD configurations while raising the Acadia’s max tow rating from 1,000 to a still-modest 4,000 pounds.
 
 2.5-liter inline-4 
 194 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (FWD), 18/25 mpg (AWD)","Pricing Notes 
 
Part of the 2017 Acadia’s downsizing involved a commensurate trimming of its overall pricing. That leaves a base Acadia SL opening at just under $30,000 -- roughly $1,900 less than in 2016 -- which undercuts starting figures for 2016 versions of the Explorer, Pilot and Highlander. SLE Acadias commence closer to $33,500 and SLTs start nearer $39,500. An AWD upgrade adds about $2,000. Topping the range, the Acadia Denali starts at just under $46,000 (FWD) or $48,000 (AWD) with a loaded AWD topping out near $52,000. Kelley Blue Book has not yet determined a residual value for the 2017 GMC Acadia, but historically it has been substantially lower than the Explorer, Pilot and Highlander. KBB’s 5-Year Cost to Own figure for the 2017 Acadia also is still pending.

The Acadia Limited is a good call for those looking for 8-passenger seating plus good cargo space, but without the size and expense of a full-size body-on-frame SUV. Decent fuel economy, good safety ratings and a pleasantly comfortable interior are icing on the cake.","You May Not Like This Car If...

Also, if you demand the latest and greatest gadgets -- like adaptive cruise control -- you might find the Acadia Limited...limiting.","The 2017 GMC Acadia Limited isn't the new Acadia, it's the old Acadia with a new-ish name. GMC is keeping the old model around alongside the new one for buyers who need the kind of 8-passenger, big-cargo capability that the new Acadia lacks. However, the Acadia Limited is still a solid crossover SUV. Compared to rivals like the Ford Flex, Mazda CX-9, Toyota Highlander and Hyundai Santa Fe, the Acadia Limited offers considerably more passenger space, and a bunch of cargo space even behind the third row. It's comfortable and quiet inside, making it a good companion for long road trips. If you can overlook things like old-school interior trim and the dated infotainment system, the Acadia Limited has a lot to offer.","Considering that the only new thing about the Acadia Limited is the word ""Limited"" on the name, this vehicle has actually been on sale now for a solid 10 years....","Favorite Features 
 
8-PASSENGER SEATING
 The Acadia Limited comes with seating for eight people, making it one of the few vehicles to offer that many seats that isn't a minivan or body-on-frame vehicle. As a bonus, none is a penalty box, either.
 
 CARGO SPACE
 Many of the Acadia Limited's rivals offer good passenger space, or good cargo room, but not both. The Acadia Limited offers generous cargo space behind the third row, meaning you don't have to compromise cargo room for passenger seating, or vice versa.","","The 2017 Acadia Limited is technically a new model, but it's really last year's; The Acadia Limited still looks good, even after a decade of being on the road. It's conservatively rugged, with few of the tacked-on silliness that you find on some SUVs. The Denali version's huge electric-razor grille is gone from the lineup, with just the 3-bar GMC grille available, and that's fine with us. The Acadia Limited gets standard 20-inch chrome wheels, and the front-end styling is augmented with tasteful LED lighting accents.","The 2017 GMC Acadia Limited is based on last year's Acadia SLT trim and comes with most of that vehicle's equipment standard. That includes 3-zone automatic climate control, a Bose audio system with USB, Bluetooth and auxiliary inputs, and 10 speakers. Leather seats are also standard, as are a head-up display and a navigation system. Safety features include side-blind-spot alert, cross-traffic alert, plus an array of features like a rearview camera, multiple airbags and stability control with rollover mitigation.","Optional Equipment 
Most vehicles come in multiple trim levels, at various price points. However, the 2017 Acadia Limited basically comes as one nicely equipped model, with only a handful of options. All-wheel drive is available, of course, as you'd expect of an SUV. Also on the options list are a sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system to make those long road trips more bearable for everyone. However, beyond that and your choice of color, the Acadia Limited is already pretty well loaded.","Pricing Notes 
 
Prices for the 2017 GMC Acadia Limited don't have much of a span. The basic FWD model carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a little less than $44,800 including the $925 destination charge. AWD adds an extra $2,000 to the total. Even if you check all the available options, you'll stay under the $50,000 mark. That compares nicely with up-level models of the Ford Flex, Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot. Of course, if that's still too much, GMC would be happy to show you the all-new, slightly smaller, and much more modern 2017 Acadia. Regardless, check what others are paying in your area with the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. Historically, the first-generation Acadia (which is basically the Acadia Limited) has had very good resale value, a little below the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, but better than just about everything else.

If you need room for up to eight passengers, as well as ample cargo room, the 2017 Chevrolet Traverse crossover SUV still offers one of the roomiest cabins in this field. Its $30,000 entry price is also quite appealing, as is the option of all-wheel drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re seeking the latest in styling and advanced driver-assist features (think adaptive cruise control and collision prevention), a Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer or Toyota Highlander is a better choice. The new 2017 GMC Acadia is also a viable choice for those wishing to remain in the GM family.","With its 3-row seating, spacious cargo bay and handsome styling, Chevrolet’s 2017 Traverse crossover SUV makes an ideal family vehicle. Although it lacks more advanced driver-assist systems found on the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer, the Traverse is still safe, competent and desirable. Mimicking the ride height and family-hauling abilities of the larger Tahoe SUV, the Traverse outmaneuvers its sibling with a more sedan-like ride and better handling. Although the V6-powered Traverse crossover SUV can’t haul or pull like a Tahoe can, it can tow up to 5,200 pounds. Not as fresh or fuel-efficient as some newer competitors, the Traverse still offers such desirable features as 7- or 8-passenger seating, a big cargo hold behind the 3rd-row seat and an exceptionally quiet cabin.","Despite the plethora of newer, nimbler and more fuel-efficient competitors, the 2017 Chevy Traverse remains a remarkably capable crossover SUV. Its strong 281-horsepower V6 places the Traverse well within range...","Favorite Features 
 
BUILT-IN WI-FI
 With the ever-increasing need to be connected to our mobile devices 24/7, the 2017 Chevrolet Traverse SUV’s built-in Wi-Fi hotspot helps keep everyone happy and connected. This subscription-based service permits up to seven devices to share the vehicle’s 4G LTE system.
 
 SMART SLIDE 2ND-ROW SEAT
 What good is a spacious 3rd-row seat if you can’t easily access it? In the 2017 Traverse, Chevrolet offers the Smart Slide 2nd-row seat that can be operated with just one hand, making it a breeze to get in and out of the rearmost seat.","","Chevrolet’s 2017 Traverse SUV is relatively unchanged from last year, with an all-new 2018 model set to debut next year. Last year’s LTZ is replaced by the Premier trim while a new, lower-priced base LS 1SM is introduced.; The Traverse is now eight years into its current design, but its style is holding up, thanks to front and rear tweaks made a few years ago. The 2017 Chevy Traverse crossover SUV bucks the blocky shape of a traditional SUV with its handsome, rounded (maybe too rounded at the rear) shape. Top-line Premier versions feature exterior mirrors with electronic blind-spot monitoring -- helpful due to the Traverse's size and compromised rear sightlines. Premier models also stand out with dual-exhaust outlets, body-color moldings and chrome accents. Lower trims have a manual liftgate, while higher ones feature a power-operated one.","Beyond its sheer amount of vehicle for the money, the Chevy Traverse offers a good roster of standard features. The LS model gives you keyless entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone connectivity, AM/FM/CD/satellite audio with a 6.5-inch touch-screen display and front and rear USB ports, and 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity. LT trims add a power-driver's seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear park assist, and power liftgate (2LT trim). Top-line Premier models bring leather, dual exhausts and a small bump in power, Bose premium audio, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and blind-spot monitoring with forward collision monitoring.","Optional Equipment 
Options vary across trims for the 2017 Chevy Traverse, but all models can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD) for better traction instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD). Other extras include navigation with traffic data, blind-spot monitoring with a rear cross-traffic alert system (standard on Premier), a power liftgate, 10-speaker Bose audio, rear-seat DVD system, and a dual-panel sunroof. Chevrolet’s MyLink Touch telematics system combines Bluetooth audio streaming, hands-free phone communication, voice recognition, and compatibility with apps such as Pandora. A subscription to the new OnStar 4G LTE system with Wi-Fi is available after the initial 3-month/3-gigabyte trial.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Chevrolet Traverse has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $29,595 for the retail-order-only 1SM and $32,195 for an LS model with no options. 1LT and 2LT models run $34,995 and $37,545, respectively, while the range-topping Traverse Premier begins at $42,940. Adding AWD is an additional $2,000. Fully loaded, a 2017 Traverse can reach over $50,000. The 2017 Traverse’s starting price is slightly higher than competitors such as the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Pathfinder, all of which are also smaller. Buyers merely seeking a bargain 3-row crossover SUV may find it in the Dodge Journey with 7-passenger seating. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As for its resale value, we expect the Traverse to be average.

If you think getting the features you want in a $30,000 SUV means having to buy used, think again. The 7-passenger 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe crossover SUV comes well equipped in base form and only gets better as you move up the trim line.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need seating for eight passengers or the ability to tow a 7,000-pound trailer, you’re going to have to move up to something larger like the Chevy Tahoe, Nissan Armada or Toyota Sequoia. Those seeking even better ride and handling might like the new Mazda CX-9.","There are many feelings owners associate with the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV, but buyer’s remorse is not one of them. A freshened exterior and more standard features make Hyundai’s 2017 Santa Fe even more appealing this year, helping it keep pace with newer competitors like the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Mazda CX-9. Offering up one of the most powerful V6 engines in its class along with ample interior room and a comfortable 3rd-row seat, the Santa Fe should appeal to those needing room, although the GMC Acadia still offers vastly more cargo space behind its 3rd-row seat. Add in a 5,000-pound tow rating and Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, and the Santa Fe begins to look like the deal of the decade.","While Mazda’s CX-9 may have set a new standard for 7-passenger SUV handling, the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV isn’t far from this benchmark.

HYUNDAI BLUE LINK TELEMATICS
 Standard on every 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe, the next-generation Blue Link telematics offers a wide range of driver assists, including turn-by-turn navigation, remote start, stolen-vehicle recovery, SOS emergency assistance and onboard diagnostic info.
 
 PANORAMIC SUNROOF
 What better way to perk up a crowded cabin than with a massive infusion of sunlight. The Santa Fe’s available panoramic sunroof spans all three rows and can be tilted up for improved ventilation or opened for a refreshing blast of fresh air.","","For 2017, Hyundai’s Santa Fe 7-passenger SUV receives updated exterior and interior styling. New standard features include a 7-inch touch screen with Android Auto, rearview camera and Driver Select Mode. New options include a Multi-View Camera, Dynamic Bending Headlights with auto high-beam assist, Smart Cruise Control and Automatic Emergency Braking.; Looking for all the world like what it is -- an extended-wheelbase Santa Fe Sport without the sporty rear-side-window kick-up -- the new Santa Fe has more to say about handsome, contemporary styling than it does about swooping lines that characterize the shapes of Hyundai passenger cars. Nice touch 1: Even in base SE form, the outside mirrors and bumpers are body-color. Integrated fog lights, roof rails and 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are the exterior differences between the SE and upscale Limited versions. Nice touch 2: The Santa Fe SE gets smaller 18-inch wheels, but at least they are aluminum-alloy.","Santa Fe SE drivers with a long journey ahead will appreciate the multi-adjustable front bucket seats with power-adjustable lumbar support. Passengers farther back will give thanks to the 3rd-row controls for air conditioning and heating. Stepping up to the Santa Fe Limited includes luxuries like leather seating -- power-adjustable and heated for the driver and front passenger -- push-button starting and an electroluminescent gauge cluster. The Limited Ultimate adds heated 2nd-row seats, an 8-inch-color navigation touch-screen monitor and Multi-View Monitor. Sweet as ever, Hyundai's confidence-inspiring 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties cover the new Santa Fe.","Optional Equipment 
Beyond a laundry list of bundled options like a heated steering wheel, navigation system, Infinity premium audio, 3rd-row USB ports and AWD, Hyundai is pushing a few new packages. For the Santa Fe SE, the Premium package brings blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, hands-free Smart liftgate and more. The Tech package for the SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate include Smart Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, lane-departure warning, electronic parking brake and HID Dynamic Bending Headlights with high-beam assist.","Pricing Notes 
 
A 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SE comes out of the gate with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of around $31,695 -- a number that is slightly higher than the 2017 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, but slightly less than a similarly equipped Honda Pilot EX. The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited starts just shy of $36,000. If you load up an AWD Santa Fe Ultimate Limited with every option, you'll still find yourself spending less than $45,000. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price for what shoppers are actually paying for the Santa Fe in your area. It's still a little early to predict the 2017 Santa Fe's resale outlook, but Hyundai SUVs consistently rank well versus their competition, on par with the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer, better than the GMC Acadia but behind the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.

If you want a smaller luxury SUV that's sporty yet practical and, perhaps most importantly, carries serious brand envy, the BMW X3 checks all the right boxes. If you want a powerful yet fuel-efficient diesel SUV, the X3 xDrive28d has a fine balance of both.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want some of the latest semi-autonomous driving aids wrapped in an ultra-classy package, check out the fresh Mercedes-Benz GLC. The new Jaguar F-Pace, meanwhile, aims to give the X3 a run for its performance money, while the Acura RDX and Infiniti QX50 cost thousands less.","Slotting between the X1 and X5, the 2017 BMW X3 is the German luxury brand's compact sport utility vehicle or, as Bimmer likes to call it, ""sports activity vehicle."" That is apt, as the X3 prioritizes dynamics over ruggedness. The 2017 X3 remains one of the most fun-to-drive crossover SUVs available. Being a BMW, the X3 also offers a long list of the premium amenities, though options easily swell the X3's nearly $40,000 starting price. Along with turbocharged 4- and 6-cylinder gasoline engines, the X3 stands out with an efficient yet powerful diesel option. The X3 remains a solid choice in the entry-level small luxury SUV space, but newer rivals like the Mercedes-Benz GLC and Jaguar F-Pace are equally if not more appealing.","Whether you prefer the gasoline-powered 4-cylinder or 6-cylinder, the BMW X3 delivers swift acceleration.

POWER AND EFFICIENCY
 Despite the bad press that diesel has been getting in the wake of VW's scandal, we needn't toss the baby with the bathwater. The diesel X3 remains a solid choice for buyers seeking high fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance.
 
 DRIVER ASSISTANCE PLUS
 This optional package includes safety and driving aids like blind-spot monitoring, surround-view camera and Active Driving Assistant, which can warn of an impending collision and even apply the brakes. For $1,700, it's money well spent.","","Only minor updates are in store for the 2017 BMW X3 luxury SUV. They include optional wireless charging for select smartphones, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a new version of BMW's iDrive infotainment/audio control. Top-line xDrive35i models get keyless entry and lumbar support as standard.; The X3's design has matured over the years and, while its suit isn't as fresh as the newer competitors, it's still sharp.

This base model includes power front seats, automatic climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a convenient power tailgate and universal garage door opener. Infotainment is brought to you by a 9-speaker/205-watt AM/FM/CD player with HD Radio, Bluetooth streaming and USB input. Unlike some rivals, BMW is behind in offering Apple CarPlay or Android Auto phone integration. The X3 is filled with passive and active safety features. 2017 model BMWs continue to offer complimentary maintenance, but it's been downgraded to 3 years/36,000 miles from 4 years/50,000 miles.","Optional Equipment 
Many of the 2017 X3's extras are bundled into packages, starting with your choice of M Sport or xLine. The first adds sporty bits like an aerodynamic kit and sport seats, while the latter has classy satin exterior brightwork and a unique steering wheel. Heated seats and steering wheel, navigation, BMW Apps and Wi-Fi hotspot are also offered in packages. Surprisingly, a rearview camera costs extra, as does any exterior color that isn't non-metallic black or white. Other options include the Driver Assistant Plus package, active cruise control and, for audio buffs, a 600-watt harman/kardon premium sound system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2017 BMW X3 sDrive28i begins slightly under $40,000; add about $2,000 to that if you want the all-wheel-drive X3 xDrive28i. If diesel efficiency is more important, the X3 xDrive28d SUV will cost more initially, over $43,000. The top-line, 6-cylinder xDrive35i starts at near $49,000. Remember that these numbers are beginning points. Options drive up the price quickly, and a fully-loaded xDrive35i can crest $60,000. The X3's base price is in line with the Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5 and Jaguar F-Pace, but higher than the Lexus NX, Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50, Lincoln MKC and Volvo XC60. It is lower, however, than the Porsche Macan. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for the X3. The X3's resale value is expected to be good over the years, but still below that of the Porsche Macan.

The 2017 Buick Envision offers a smaller, upscale crossover SUV with a calm and refined driving manner, roomy interior, and at a decent price. Basically, it's the Buick of compact crossover SUVs, but in the modern sense, where you're getting a sophisticated and elegant vehicle, and not grandma's church-mobile.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
As nice as it is -- and it's pretty nice -- Buick still doesn't have the cachet of BMW or Mercedes-Benz. Additionally, the BMW X3, Infiniti QX50, Audi Q5 and Acura RDX all offer sharper handling.","For 2017 Buick’s Envision compact-premium crossover SUV is now a full lineup of vehicles, with new base, Preferred and Essence models joining last year's Premium models. With the new models comes a new base engine, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, and a lower entry price. The new Buick Envision competes against premium SUVs like the Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC and Audi Q5, leaving the BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class to its cousin, the Cadillac XT5. It offers up plenty of high-end features on the options and standard-equipment lists, and for a reasonable price through the range. We think the 2017 Envision is sure to make solid inroads against its competition, and maybe draw in new shoppers to the Buick showroom in the process.","The 2017 Buick Envision Premium models come with a 252-horsepower 4-cylinder mated to all four wheels through a 6-speed automatic. It's an impressive combination, with the 4-cylinder providing enough juice...","Favorite Features 
 
QUIET CABIN
 Between Buick's QuietTuning technology -- which is basically smart use of sound-deadening materials -- and high-tech active noise cancellation, the 2017 Buick Envision is a sanctuary from the noise and stress of the outside world.
 
 REAR-SEAT ACCOMMODATIONS
 There is a decently sized rear seat, as you'd expect in an SUV. But unlike many of its competitors, the Buick has no hump on the floor to ruin the middle seating position. Some clever engineering eliminated this hump, even in all-wheel-drive models.","The 2017 Envision seats five passengers in comfort, including the center position thanks to the flat rear floor. Rear passengers in Essence and Premium models get their own climate controls, plus USB ports and a 120v outlet. Nestled in their standard heated seats, the driver and front passenger will enjoy easy-to-see-and-use controls and buttons for the climate and audio systems, mainly because they're actual buttons and knobs, and not the finicky touch-based systems employed by others, including some GM brands. We'll let you decide if the analog clock on the upper right of the standard 8-inch infotainment screen is odd or refreshing.","Buick’s 2017 Envision cuts a clean profile, bearing a definite family resemblance to the subcompact, nearly nubby Encore SUV and the larger, bloated-looking Enclave, while managing to look better than both. True, it's conservative, but handsomely so, with nice proportions and just enough sculpting on the sides and hood to keep you interested without assaulting your vision. We like the standard power tailgate that has adjustable lift height and hands-free operation (just stick your foot near the bumper). We wouldn't mind the hood portholes if they actually did something, but the purely decorative bits look too tacked-on.","While the new base model 2017 Envision is more lightly equipped, it's still a lot of premium-compact SUV for the money. Buyers get dual-zone climate control, a power liftgate, tilt-and-telescope steering, and cloth seats with Leatherette trim. It also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 8-way-power front seats with power lumbar and heaters, and an infotainment system that includes an 8-inch color touch screen and 6-speaker audio system, a rearview camera and backup sensors, plus 10 airbags and six months of complimentary OnStar service. Also standard on the base model is the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine powering just the front wheels.","Optional Equipment 
Options are added by working your way up the model ladder. Moving to Preferred lets you choose all-wheel drive (AWD), while Essence models add things like rear-seat climate control, blind-spot monitor, heated rear outboard seats, memory for the front seats, and leather seating surfaces all around. It also offers a heated steering wheel. Step up to Premium I or Premium II and you'll get the turbocharged engine and standard dual-clutch all-wheel drive (AWD), plus rear cross-traffic alert, front parking sensors, lane-keeping assist and forward-collision alert. Premium II models can add a surround-vision camera, automatic braking and adaptive cruise control.","Under the Hood 
 
Two engine choices await 2017 Buick Envision buyers. First is the base engine, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 197 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic transmission to the front or, in Essence models, all four wheels. The Premium and Premium II models both use the 2.0-liter 252-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder that debuted last year. It sends power through a 6-speed automatic and a different AWD system that uses a dual-clutch system for better power delivery. Power from the turbo is more than adequate, if not segment-leading, with negligible lag and impressive torque available at a low rpm. Fuel economy in front-wheel-drive (FWD) models is an EPA estimated 29 mpg on the highway; it's lower in the AWD turbos, which also require premium fuel.
 
 2.5-liter inline-4
 197 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm
 192 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/29 mpg (FWD); 21/28 mpg (AWD)
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4
 252 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 260 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/26 mpg
 
Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base 2017 Buick Envision is just under $35,000 when you include the $925 destination charge. Preferred models start about $1,800 higher than that, and Essence models are another $1,900 higher. An all-wheel-drive Envision Essence model will run a little shy of $40,500. If you want turbo power, the Premium model starts a little above $43,000, and the top-line Premium II is just under $46,000. The base prices of lower-end models are in line with many of its rivals, including the Acura RDX, Lexus NX, Infiniti QX50, and thousands less than less than the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Envision. As this is such a new vehicle, the Envision SUV's resale value is still to be determined.

While the Discovery is the lowest priced Range Rover vehicle, the Evoque is more stylish, and that doesn't even include the new convertible.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
There's no question the Evoque trades function for form, with a small interior, moderate cargo space and a price that starts low, but climbs rapidly.

Instead, the Evoque's small size, relatively affordable price, and adorably pugnacious style make it ideal for the city set who wants the luxury cachet that comes with the green Land Rover badge, but is unlikely to do more off-roading than accidentally putting a wheel on the lawn. It goes head-to-head against the BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and the like. But its styling makes it stand apart, along with the availability of a new convertible. However, this is no soft-roader, with a switchable terrain mode and full-time all-wheel drive making it more capable on rough terrain than you might think.","The Range Rover Evoque is in fact an actual Land Rover, with unexpectedly good capability when the tires leave paved roads.

 The Evoque is all-wheel drive (AWD) up to 22 mph. Then it switches to front-wheel-drive (FWD) mode to save fuel, the Range Rover equivalent of sipping tea with an extended pinkie. If the system detects low traction, it immediately redirects torque to the rear wheels to enhance traction.

 The Evoque's Terrain Response system lets you choose among several different modes depending on the prevailing conditions. Select Snow, Sand or Trail modes, and the throttle input, suspension settings, and other systems alter to best enhance traction for the given condition.","","Biggest news for the 2017 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is the addition of the new convertible model.

 NEW ENGINE, NEW ENERGY
 While the outgoing 6-cylinder X4 was hardly a slouch with its 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, the new variant packs even more punch.

The 2017 BMW X4’s style over practicality is not inexpensive. The base X4, starting just over $46,000, is roughly $6,000 more than a base X3; although the X4 includes all-wheel drive, an extra $2,000 for an X3. The up-level X4 M40i starts near $59,000. Loaded, an X4 can top $66,000. Apples to apples competitors to the X4 are few but, for a rough idea, a Range Rover Evoque starts a few thousand below in 5-door guise and a little higher than the X4 in coupe form, the sleek new Jaguar F-Pace also starts a few thousand below the X4, and the smaller Mercedes-Benz GLA begins in the mid-$30,000 range.

VALUE PRICING
 Small-luxury SUVs can have big-size price tags, especially when ladled with options. Compared to most rivals -- especially its German ones -- the Infiniti QX50 is a bargain. For well under $40,000 you get a luxury SUV with serious power and a surprising amount of amenities.
 
 POWERED THIS, POWERED THAT
 Among those aforementioned surprising amenities available are a power-adjustable steering wheel and power up-folding rear seats. That latter feature allows you to raise the rear seats from a folded position via the touch of a button, instead of wrestling with them after unloading cargo.","","After a revision last year that granted a much-needed dose of rear legroom and some styling updates, the QX50 sees little change for 2017.

It includes 11-speaker Bose premium audio, power-adjustable steering wheel with entry/exit assist, aluminum roof rails, auto-dimming rearview mirror, HomeLink garage-door opener and advanced climate system with automatic filtration and the ability to close vents when exhaust fumes are detected. There are navigation with real-time traffic, power-up rear seats, bird's-eye-view rearview camera, and front and rear sonar parking aid. Safety highlights include lane-departure warning and prevention, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning and intelligent cruise control. One glaring omission: a power rear tailgate.","Pricing Notes 
 
With a base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $35,445, the 2017 Infiniti QX50 remains a stellar value among small-luxury SUVs.

Other options include a highly recommended Driver Assistance package that bundles together a rearview camera with active guidelines and front and rear parking sensors, and a Cold Weather Package that includes heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 BMW 230i starts reasonably, right around $34,000 including the $995 destination charge. The 2017 BMW M240i Coupe starts around $45,500. AWD on either model costs an extra $2,000. Order all the options, and you'll wind up with a 230i and M240i costing about $50,000 and $55,000, respectively. Convertible models add about $5,500 to the price of a 230i coupe, or about $4,600 to the price of an M240i. The Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA start a grand or two lower. The less refined Acura ILX starts even lower, around $29,000, but you lose performance and cachet in the bargain. Check out Kelley Blue Book’s Fair Purchase Price Tool before heading to the dealership. We expect the 2017 BMW 2 Series coupe to retain slightly above-average residual values, better than the Acura ILX, on par with the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA.

There aren’t too many 4-seat convertibles on the market and even fewer that offer a usable rear seat. If you’re seeking such a car, the 2017 Buick Cascada convertible has a lower starting price than its German rivals and even the base car is exceptionally well-equipped.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Cascada’s 3-year-old Opel architecture precludes it from offering more modern features such as blind-spot warning, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or a push-button starter. Those looking for razor-sharp handling will likely be happier in a BMW or Audi.","Buick has not had a convertible in its repertoire for nearly 25 years, which is why the 2017 Cascada convertible is such a milestone in the company’s comeback story. Introduced last year, the Cascada is actually an Opel bearing the same name in Europe. Buick’s version of course gets more luxury features as well as an enhanced suspension and all those little touches Americans love. The front-drive 2017 Buick Cascada convertible isn’t just a 2-person affair; it’s a roomy 2+2 with a decent-size trunk making it a worthy rival to cars like the BMW 2 Series, Audi A3 and VW Beetle drop-tops. A 200-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged engine powers all three Cascada trims, including the new Sport Touring.","While we wouldn’t pit a 2017 Buick Cascada against a BMW 2 Series in the corners, for the way most people drive, this drop-top Buick should prove most satisfying. Designed...","Favorite Features 
 
POWER-ACTIVATED SOFT TOP
 The 2017 Cascada features a fully powered retractable soft top that can be cycled up or down in a mere 17 seconds, even while the car is moving at speeds up to 30 mph. Inside, the top features multiple fabric layers that do an excellent job keeping heat in and noise out.
 
 EASY REAR-SEAT ENTRY/EXIT SYSTEM
 To assist with easy rear-seat entry and exit, the Cascada’s power front bucket seats automatically move forward or backward once the seatback is moved forward. The seats will also stop their rearward travel should they sense a set of knees in the way.","Nicely detailed and well appointed, Buick’s 2017 Cascada’s leather-lined cabin can be criticized a bit for displaying a few dated design details. However, it’s impressively roomy for a 2+2, and the car’s individual fold-down rear seats will accommodate two average-size adults if its well-formed, 8-way-power front seats also are carrying similarly scaled occupants. Although Buick’s signature Quiet Tuning is most evident with the top up, sound levels and wind buffeting remain commendably low even when the Cascada is running in al fresco mode. However, flipping its lid does trim the car’s generous 13.4 cubic-foot trunk capacity to a still-serviceable 9.8 cubic feet.","Save for minor cosmetic detailing on the grille, lighting elements and rolling stock, the Buick Cascada’s styling is virtually identical to its Opel-badged alter ego. But that’s hardly a bad thing. Open or closed, the new Cascada’s cleanly styled convertible bodywork and well-rendered top treatment ensure great curb appeal from virtually any angle. Save for unique finishes, the standard Cascada and Premium variant fill their nicely flared wheel arches with 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels wrapped in beefy 245/40 all-season tires.","To enhance the Cascada’s appeal, both base and the Premium variants come with a bounty of upline features that complement the excellent soft top, and a full range of power assists. Highlighting that formidable roster are auto-controlled high-intensity headlights, heat-reflective leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel and seats, Buick's IntelliLink system with a 7.0-inch color display, OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot, Siri Eyes Free for iOS phones, a navigation system, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, Rear Park Assist, electric seatbelt presenters, dual 12V powerpoints, and spring-loaded/pyrotechnically activated popup rollover bars behind the rear seat linked to the car’s seatbelt system.","Optional Equipment 
Options are a relative commodity on the Cascada. Save for a few extra-cost exterior colors, all versions of the Cascada convertible are mono-spec offerings. The only upgrades included on the Cascada Premium and Sport Touring models add Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning, front as well as rear Park Assist, tunnel detection for the automatic-headlight control, Rainsense automatic wipers, front/rear air deflectors, and a unique “diamond-graphic” finish on the wheels on the Premium and a Sterling Silver finish on the Sport Touring.","Under the Hood 
 
There’s just one powertrain for all three Cascada variants: a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that drives the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. Part of GM’s new-generation Ecotec family, this free-revving four boasts direct injection and continuously variable-valve timing that help it turn out 200 horsepower -- a heady 125 horsepower per liter. It also develops 207 lb-ft of torque from 1,800-4,500 rpm, which can be cranked up to 221 lb-ft in 10-second bursts thanks to an overboost function. A remapping of throttle response also helps enhance the car’s pleasantly brisk acceleration. The modest downside to that enthusiasm is fuel economy. With EPA ratings of 20/27 city/highway mpg, the Cascada falls well shy of best in class.
 
 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4
 200 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 207 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-4,500 rpm (221 lb-ft @ 2,200-4,000 rpm w/overboost)
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Buick Cascada in base 1SV trim has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $34,000, while the Premium model with its active/passive driver assists opens at the slightest nudge under $37,000. The Sport Touring adds another $1,000 to the bottom line. The Premium’s price is roughly where the Audi A3 and BMW 2 Series convertibles commence and while domestic drop-top alternatives like the Ford Mustang and upcoming Chevy Camaro may start lower, neither of those models includes standards like leather, power seats and navigation, items that further burnish the Cascada’s overall value story. Before you set out to purchase, be sure to check KBB’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for the 2017 Buick Cascada in your area. We expect the Cascada to hold average values a few points below the BMW 2 Series and Ford Mustang, but on par with the Audi A3 Cabriolet.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK combines the dual pleasures of a hardtop 2-seat coupe and a premium luxury roadster. Either way, it coddles you around town, offers a premium driving experience you expect from Mercedes-Benz, and looks great doing it.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you're tall enough for people to assume you're great at basketball, you're going to find the Mercedes-Benz SLK a tight fit. A 4-seat convertible may suit you better, like the Audi A5/S5 or the new C-Class convertible. Enthusiast drivers will gravitate to the BMW Z4 or the Porsche Boxster.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class has the best kind of split personality. At first it's a secure, cozy coupe, but with the push of a button, it's a fun-loving open-air roadster thanks to the hardtop convertible top. Like the BMW Z4, its transformer-like ability isn't just a neat parlor trick, it actually adds a dose of practicality to the SLK. This year, the 2016 SLK300 takes the place of last year's SLK250, with a more powerful engine and new 9-speed automatic transmission. But unless you're choosing the 415-horsepower AMG SLK55, the Mercedes-Benz SLK skews more toward plusher ride compared to rivals like the Z4, the Audi TT and the Porsche Boxster. And of course, fundamental to SLK luxury roadsters are the prestige and pampering inherent in Mercedes-Benz vehicles.","We're fans of the new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder now available in the 2016 SLK300, having sampled it in vehicles like the new C-Class sedan and GLC-Class luxury SUV. Smooth and...","Favorite Features 
 
RETRACTABLE HARDTOP
 The SLK-Class didn't invent the retractable hardtop, but it made it mainstream when the roadster debuted in 1998. It's easy to see why the technology became commonplace: In less than 20 seconds, the SLK can transform from buttoned-down coupe to sun-seeking convertible.
 
 AIRSCARF & AIR GUIDES
 Even convertible die-hards get cold, so to make the SLK-Class as all-weather as possible, Mercedes-Benz engineers developed adjustable Air Guide draft deflectors on each rollbar and the Airscarf system, which delivers warm air to your neck from an outlet in the headrest.","","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class gets a new engine and model designation to go with it. A 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder backed by a new 9-speed automatic transmission now anchors the bottom of the line in the new SLK300. Option packages are simplified, and the manual transmission for the now-defunct SLK250 disappears.; The 2016 SLK-Class boasts the classic long-hood/short-trunk profile that defines a roadster. Top up, it looks like a luxurious coupe, and you might even be hard-pressed to tell that the top goes down at all. Yet press the button and it retracts in 20 seconds, giving you the open-air thrills you long for. It's small too, just a few inches longer than a Mazda Miata, making it easy to maneuver around town and in tight parking places. The AMG SLK55 model uses tinted headlight housings, quad exhaust outlets and a small rear spoiler to up the visual adrenaline.","Along with the new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and 9-speed automatic transmission, the base 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK300 also comes with a 5.8-inch infotainment display, an 8-speaker audio system with a USB port and Bluetooth streaming, auto-dimming mirrors and 8-way-power seats. That retractable roof also features a standard panoramic glass panel. There's an Eco mode that includes automatic start/stop to help save a few drops of fuel at stoplights, and an attention-assist feature that monitors the driver for drowsiness. Other safety features include active head restraints, along with plenty of airbags and stability control.","Optional Equipment 
Beyond opting for V6 or V8 engines, options are mostly divided into groups, and even those are simplified for the 2016 model year. The Premium 1 package adds the Airscarf, heated seats, keyless ignition and entry, and remote hardtop operation, plus an upgraded audio system. A Premium 2 package adds active high beams, brighter headlights, navigation, dual-zone climate control, and more. The Premium 3 package includes active cruise control and lane-keeping assist, parking assist and an adaptive suspension. Stand-alone options include the Magic Sky Control roof, and if you want extreme customization, there's the Designo exterior and interior trim.","Pricing Notes 
 
For 2016, the Mercedes-Benz SLK300 comes with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $48,000, including the $925 destination charge. That's not bad, but options quickly up the price. For example, if you want any color besides black, white or red, you're paying at least an extra $720 for the privilege. The SLK 350 starts at a little more than $60,000, while the AMG SLK55 is more than $73,500. Despite this, at the low end the SLK actually undercuts the more powerful BMW Z4 by a couple thousand dollars, with the margin even wider between the Benz and Porsche Boxster. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Mercedes roadster. The 2016 SLK's resale value is expected to be good. Four-cylinder variants are predicted to best hold their value but still match the Porsche Boxster.

The fact that it's a terrific all-around driving experience conducted in sumptuous luxury is practically a bonus.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Audi A5 and its siblings are luxury cars and thus aren't cheap. Additionally, they're not alone, and similarly sized and priced coupes from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Cadillac and others make compelling cases for themselves.","The 2016 Audi A5 and Audi S5 are luxury sports coupes that are just as thrilling to drive as they are to behold. The exterior and interior styling look more like exhibits from a museum of fine art. But once you get behind the wheel, you discover that there's literally more to these cars than meets the eye. The 220-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder in the standard A5 is solid, with standard all-wheel drive and sharp reflexes. But there's also the 333-horsepower 3.0-liter supercharged V6 in the S5 for those who want even more.

3.0-LITER SUPERCHARGED V6 
Audi’s supercharged 3.0-liter V6 in the S5 is an excellent upgrade from the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in the A5. With 333 horsepower, 325 lb-ft of torque, snappy response, silky smoothness and commendable fuel economy, it comes with either a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic. 
 
SUPERMODEL EXTERIOR 
Just sit back and look at this car for a moment, and marvel that the Audi A5 coupe can look as good as it does even after nearly 10 years on the road. Its striking good looks are one of the major reasons for considering the purchase.","","The powerful; Audi has mastered the art of designing conservatively attractive cars, and the 2016 A5 is a prime example. The sleek lines help tone down the brand's signature oversize grille, while the grille itself makes this car unmistakably Audi. The bold grille is flanked by LED headlight accents to create an unmistakable face, while the finely tailored sheet metal shows off the lovely flowing curves along the sides with carefully executed creases and crisp detailing.","This year, all new Audi A5 models get the upscale S line exterior treatment. Other standard equipment on the A5 includes a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, quattro AWD, 3-zone automatic climate control, tilt/telescope steering wheel, a panoramic sunroof and 10-way adjustable power leather seats. There's Bluetooth and iPod integration for the 10-speaker audio system, and even automatic headlights and windshield wipers. Audi S5 models add the supercharged V6 engine, plus Alcantara upholstery and keyless entry and ignition.","Optional Equipment 
Options for the 2016 Audi A5 and Audi S5 include high-intensity-discharge headlights, LED taillights and a variety of wheel packages. Navigation now includes Audi connect, which allows searches using Google Earth, providing realistic terrain imagery, as well as the ability to send destinations from any browser directly to the car. Audi A5 and S5 convertible models can be ordered with a Red Acoustic convertible top, and the Black Optic Plus Package for the Audi S5 gets new 20-inch wheels.","Pricing Notes 
 
Prices for a 2016 Audi A5 Coupe with a manual transmission start at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $41,500, including the $925 destination charge. Step up to the more powerful S5 model (you'll thank us) and you'll pay about $54,000. There's a convertible version of each, with the A5 Cabriolet starting just below $50,000, and the S5 drop-top a bit above $62,000.

With it up, the VW appears to be a coupe, though one marked by lines intertwining its roof and body, allowing the complex folding of its metal and glass roof. Top down, the Eos is a nicely proportioned open-air pleaser. The 2016 VW Eos rides on 17-inch alloy wheels. As mentioned in Favorite Features, the roof houses a large, 44-by-22-inch sunroof. The roof itself lowers and rises in 25 seconds.","The 2016 Volkswagen Eos Komfort includes dual-zone climate control, 12-way-power adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats and V-Tex imitation leather upholstery. Navigation is standard and is displayed on a 5-inch touch screen. Entertainment is provided by an 8-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary-in jack, Bluetooth streaming and an iPod cable. As with other new VWs, the 2016 Eos includes one year/10,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance and three years/36,000 miles of roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
Outside of a few dealer-installed add-ons like remote start, a first-aid kit and rear lip spoiler, there are no options or packages for VW’s 2016 Eos Convertible.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 VW Eos Komfort Convertible has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $33,000. At this price, the Eos undercuts the Lexus IS C, which starts at nearly $44,000, and the Infiniti Q60 Convertible that starts at almost $50,000. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Eos. The VW Eos' resale value has traditionally not been strong.

If you’re seeking a Civic-sized car with an upscale pedigree, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 makes a great choice. Strong performance and impressive handling make this one fun ride, and those with deep pockets will love the performance offered by the AMG CLA45.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need a reasonably sized rear seat and lots of equipment for your $35,000, you’ll be better off looking at a non-luxury brand like the Kia Optima, Chrysler 300 or Nissan Maxima. The CLA-Class may look like a bargain on paper, but adding options quickly moves the price north.","As the least expensive sedan in the automaker’s lineup, one might think the 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class 4-door coupe would be just a bargain-basement ploy to lure customers into the showroom. But, this hot little machine is anything but hype. Designed to take on the Audi A3, Acura ILX and Infiniti Q30, the 2017 CLA-Class can run circles around the competition, with standout styling and a high-performance AMG CLA45 version that pumps out an impressive 375 horsepower. Even the base CLA250 offers plenty to like, with a willing turbocharged engine, available all-wheel drive and a starting price just under $33,400. If you can live with the cramped rear seat and limited visibility, the 2017 MB CLA250 is ideal for first-time luxury-car buyers.","Generations of Mercedes-Benz cars have been pushed by their rear wheels, so the fact that the 2017 CLA250 4-door coupe is pulled by its front tires might seem like a...","Favorite Features 
 
PANORAMA ROOF
 The optional panoramic glass sunroof is a great way to open up the 2017 MB CLA-Class’s snug cabin. When open, the cockpit is filled with fresh air and sunshine. Leave the glass portion closed but with the sunshade retracted, and you’ll gain lots of light while creating a bit more headroom.
 
 AMG CLA45 4MATIC
 For those who can afford the premium, the AMG CLA45 4Matic delivers impressive power, handling and sophistication far better than any Acura ILX, Infiniti Q30 or Audi S3, but on par with the BMW M2.","","For 2017,","Even the least expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan offers many standard features. Among them are dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 12-way-power driver's seat with memory and a brake-hold feature that applies the brake for you at stoplights. The CLA's infotainment system includes AM/FM/HD Radio with CD player, USB port and Bluetooth streaming, all seen and controlled by the 7-inch display and command dial. The CLA250 boasts impressive safety features including systems that detect driver drowsiness (Attention Assist), a rearview monitor and Active Brake Assist, which uses radar to warn the driver of a potential collision and, if necessary, even applies the brakes.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 CLA-Class offers a plethora of options, most bundled into packages. Most notable are navigation, harman/kardon premium audio, blind-spot monitoring, leather upholstery, heated front seats, smart cruise control, parallel-parking assist, panoramic sunroof, and adaptive suspension. AWD is optional on CLA250 models and standard on the AMG variant. That performance model can be further heightened with the AMG Dynamic Plus Package that raises the top speed to 167 mph, adds a Race Start setting and a limited-slip front differential. Mercedes' mbrace Connect service offers remote access from your phone. Five years' service is complimentary.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,400. Add AWD and you're looking at $2,000 more, and when you start adding option packages, this ""inexpensive"" Mercedes-Benz can easily swell toward $40,000. However, for around $37,000, you're looking at a lot of car with plenty of options. The CLA45 AMG starts considerably higher, around $51,000. However, even that is a bargain of sorts, since it's the least expensive AMG-badged model you can get. The Audi A3, a subcompact-luxury rival, starts slightly less than the Mercedes CLA-Class, while the Acura ILX is several thousand below. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's residual value is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.

Audi has perfected the art of blending wood, leather and modern-day electronics to create a one-of-kind cabin that is often imitated but never duplicated. Audi’s A4 luxury sedan for 2016 employs a powerful yet fuel-efficient turbocharged engine that can be teamed with quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) and even the option of a manual transmission. Moving from luxury to high-performance is the 2016 Audi S4 sedan. Propelled by a supercharged V6 and quattro AWD, the S4 delivers an exhilarating driving experience that easily rivals that of the BMW 3 Series, Cadillac CTS-V and Infiniti Q50S AWD.","With many luxury performance sedans, you have a choice between stellar handling but a harsh ride, or a soft ride and boring driving characteristics.

TURBOCHARGED ENGINE 
Audi has been putting turbocharged engines in its luxury sedans for decades and it has practically perfected the formula. The 2.0-liter A4 engine is smooth, powerful and efficient, although it does fall short of the fuel-economy figures posted by the turbo-4 in the BMW 320i. 
 
DETAIL EXECUTION 
There’s a certain artistry in the way Audi assembles the A4’s interior, from the delicate wood inlays to the harmonious shapes to the soft leather seats. There is no mistaking an Audi interior for any other.","","Audi’s A4 and S4 sedans for 2016 receive a few upgrades including a standard 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel on the entry-level Premium trim, a Bang & Olufsen sound system added to the Technology package on Premium Plus trims and new 19-inch wheels for the S line competition plus package.; The 2016 Audi A4’s signature look is certainly familiar, and it remains exceptionally handsome and refined. There is no mistaking it’s an Audi, with the clean and elegantly detailed exterior that makes it one of the best-looking sedans on the road. There are numerous option packages that include different wheel treatments to individualize the appearance, and the high-end and super-performance S4 has a more aggressive look that emphasizes its purposeful mission.","The 2016 Audi A4 line is available in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. Premium leads off with 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power front seats, leather upholstery, Sirius satellite radio and the Convenience Package, which includes Bluetooth, HomeLink, Audi Music Interface connectivity, and the driver-information system. Premium Plus models tout unique 18-inch, 10-spoke wheels for a sportier appearance. Keyless entry and start is part of the Premium Plus, and Audi drive select is standard on the S4. The Prestige trim also includes navigation and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.","Optional Equipment 
The A4 Prestige package offers further upgrades to the S line package, which includes sport suspension, 19-inch wheels, different front and rear fascias, side skirts, unique doorsills and badging. A4 Prestige models also offer a Driver Assist package, consisting of adaptive cruise control (automatically maintains a distance from a vehicle in front) and adjustment of control dynamics, including steering effort, throttle response and transmission-shift characteristics. The A4 and S4 models also offer a Sport Plus package with high-gloss exterior trim and 19-inch Titanium Rotor design wheels.","Pricing Notes 
 
Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Audi A4 sedan starts just under $37,000 for a Premium trim with the CVT and front-wheel drive. That same driveline in Prestige trim is around $44,000. Move to the 6-speed manual with quattro AWD, and prices range from around $38,000 for the Premium to nearly $45,000 for the Prestige. Load on the two packages available for Prestige (S line and Driver Assist), and your A4 will be well over $50,000. The hard-charging S4 starts around $50,000 and can easily go far beyond $60,000. Be sure to check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for the A4 in your area. In resale value, the Audi A4 doesn’t do as well as the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Lexus IS, but it's on par with the Cadillac CTS and holds up better than the Lincoln MKZ and Volvo S60.

For the money, we think the 2017 Grand Cherokee SUV is Jeep’s best all-around vehicle. With models ranging from the most basic 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Laredo to the performance-oriented 475-horsepower SRT, and a tow rating up to 7,400 pounds, the Grand Cherokee offers something for everyone.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If off-road adventuring isn’t really your thing, you can find any number of front-wheel-drive, 5-passenger SUVs for less money than a loaded 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Need a third row? You’ll have to look to the Nissan Pathfinder, Honda Pilot or Ford Explorer.","As the flagship model for the iconic Jeep brand, the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV carries a heavy responsibility. Thankfully, with models ranging from basic to brutal, this 5-passenger SUV has the goods to stay one step ahead of rivals like the Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. And, with the exception of Toyota’s 4Runner, few other SUVs in this class can go where the Grand Cherokee feels most at home. The Grand Cherokee also has a luxurious side that allows the Summit trim to challenge premium SUVs such as the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE. With two powerful V8 engines and a diesel V6 option, Jeep’s Grand Cherokee for 2017 certainly feels like a premium brand, although its price tag may say otherwise.","While Jeep loves to portray its 2017 Grand Cherokee SUV tackling all manner of off-road adventures, the truth is many will rarely see more than a few gravel-strewn or snow-covered...","Favorite Features 
 
UCONNECT ACCESS
 Jeep’s Uconnect infotainment system is one of the best in the industry. An 8.4-inch touch panel displays large, easy-to-see graphics, and the system’s voice-recognition software allows for control of the navigation, audio, hands-free texting and mobile apps such as Pandora.
 
 QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION
 Jeep’s new Grand Cherokee SUV offers an optional air suspension with five separate height settings. At its highest, the Grand Cherokee delivers 10.6 inches of ground clearance. At its lowest setting, entry and exit are made easier and aerodynamics is improved. Trailhawks get a modified version for improved wheel articulation.","","Along with a new grille and the addition of a rearview camera and rear parking sensors, the Jeep’s Grand Cherokee for 2017 gains a new Trailhawk and revised Summit trim. The Trailhawk includes Quadra-Drive II, a unique air suspension, 18-inch off-road wheels and tires and an electronic limited-slip differential.; The 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road intent, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower. The Trailhawk gets distinctive red tow hooks, an anti-glare hood decal and 18-inch off-road wheels. Most Grand Cherokees receive a redesigned 7-slot grille, while higher-end models feature extra chrome. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.","As mentioned, the least expensive Grand Cherokee for 2017, the Laredo, still requires drivers to manually adjust their seat, but does come with dual-zone climate control, a digital instrument cluster, rearview camera and parking sensors, keyless entry and a 6-speaker audio system with a 5-inch touch screen. For less than $5,000 more, we recommend stepping up to at least the Laredo 75th Anniversary Edition, which includes the 8.4-inch Uconnect system, heated and power-operated front seats, heated steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview mirror, rearview camera with backup sensors and 18-inch wheels.","Optional Equipment 
The Jeep Grand Cherokee's Quadra-Trac I 4WD system is optional, and a must if you intend to go Jeeping in your Jeep. The Quadra-Lift air suspension plus the top-spec Quadra-Drive II 4WD system are essential for any hard-core off-roader. The standard halogen headlights are so-so at best, so the optional xenon setup is a better bet. In a true sign of the times, a CD player has been relegated to the options list. Other options: a Blu-ray entertainment center, dual-pane sunroof and 19-speaker harman/kardon audio system, plus blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning with crash mitigation and lane-departure warning.","Pricing Notes 
 
Jeep’s 2017 Grand Cherokee SUV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $31,300 for a 2WD Laredo model. Higher trims run from the mid- to high-$40,000 mark, and options can add thousands more. The Trailhawk starts around $44,000 while a Summit 4WD comes in just under $54,500. On top is the Grand Cherokee SRT, a specialized version more tuned for on-road speed and handling, which begins just under $68,000 and can blow past the $70,000 mark with options. At these prices the Grand Cherokee starts less than a Toyota 4Runner and slightly above a Ford Edge and Nissan Murano, though the last two are clearly oranges to this apple. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee is expected to have good resale value, but can't match the stellar heights of the Toyota 4Runner.

Despite its 9.3 inches of ground clearance, the XC90 is still no match for SUVs like the Land Rover Range Rover.","After launching one of the most ambitious design overhauls in modern memory, Volvo’s XC90 crossover SUV for 2017 utterly validates the Swedish automaker’s efforts. The 7-passenger XC90 breaks new ground on a number of fronts, the most obvious being under its hood where 4-cylinder turbocharged and supercharged Drive-E engines replace what is traditionally the job of a V6 or V8. All-wheel drive is available on the T5 and standard on the T6, while the T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid is enhanced by a rear electric motor replacing the traditional mechanical setup. Taking direct aim at the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and Acura MDX, the XC90 offers a fresh design, more intriguing interior toys and a revolutionary drivetrain marking a new beginning in Volvo engineering.","Volvo’s 2017 XC90 luxury-crossover SUV moves both the segment and the company into uncharted territory. Marrying a new double-wishbone-front/multilink-rear suspension to the SPA (Scalable Product Architecture) creates a lightweight yet...","Favorite Features 
 
SENSUS TOUCH CONTROL INTERFACE
 The XC90’s central control panel is a 9-inch high-definition infrared touch screen with tablet-style controls. The Sensus interface sets a new bar for controlling infotainment, navigation and climate controls, and its long body limits the need for constant scrolling in order to view screens or options.
 
 EXCELLENCE
 It’s a word sometimes overused by luxury manufacturers, but in this case it’s spot-on. The T8 Excellence trim includes rear seating for two, with heated and ventilated massaging seats that recline and are separated by a wide center console containing a refrigerator and fold-out airline-style tables.","","Volvo’s 2017 XC90 SUV drops the Inscription trim from the T5 but adds an 8-inch driver’s display, LED headlights and, on R-Design trims and higher, Apple CarPlay. The T8 gains a new Excellence trim bringing heated and ventilated massaging rear seats, a built-in refrigerator and 20-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio.; The XC90’s bold and sophisticated SUV body lines are complemented by a rectangular face that features a sleeker graphic character with a revised grille and redrawn logo. More expressive front/rear lighting adds visual punch and features full LED headlights with corner-following Active Bending and T-shaped “Thor’s Hammer” LED running lights. Wheel/tire fitments rise from 18-inchers on the base model to 20 inch on Inscriptions and 21 inch on the R-Design -- which also gets a selection of unique trim elements and offers a bespoke Matte Metallic Blue finish.","All XC90s are comprehensively equipped, complementing a lengthy roster of features with premium touches like the groundbreaking Sensus touch-control interface and GPS navigation, a 10-speaker/330-watt audio package, 4-zone climate control with Clean Zone Air Quality System, panoramic glass sunroof and Wi-Fi hotspot. Its bounty of active/passive protective touches include Volvo’s City Safety System with Pedestrian & Cyclist Detection and Avoidance, Lane Departure Warning, and new Run-Off-Road protection plus automatic braking should the driver inadvertently turn in front of an oncoming vehicle. Surprisingly, the new XC90 offers just one built-in USB port and has no power assist for its tilt/telescoping steering column.","Optional Equipment 
Descriptively named Climate, Convenience and Vision Packages add even more appeal to the new XC90. These include Surround View Cameras, power-retracting side-view mirrors, and heating controls for the windshield, the headlight washers and the rear seats. Blind Spot/Cross Traffic warnings, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist and Park Assist Pilot are also available as part of option packages. Single options on all models include Four-Corner Air Suspension, a 1,400-watt Bowers & Wilkins premium sound system, Head-Up Display, plus an Integrated 2nd-row child booster seat along with Contour Seats in Nappa leather (Momentum only), and carbon-fiber accents and 22-inch wheels (R-Design only).","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volvo XC90 T5 Momentum has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just shy of $46,750, while the sporty R-Design starts just north of $52,000. All-wheel drive adds another $2,000. The XC90 T6 AWD starts around $52,500, with the Inscription trim pushing the price just north of $58,000. The XC90 T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid starts close to $73,000 and tops out over $105,000 for a nicely equipped T8 Excellence. Given its numerous standard features, the 2017 XC90 will hold a solid price advantage against its comparably equipped German rivals and be competitive with the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 as well as domestic alternatives like the Cadillac SRX and the Buick Enclave. Be sure to check the KBB Fair Purchase Price before purchasing your 2017 XC90. We expect the XC90 to hold good resale value, still below that of the Acura MDX but slightly better than the Mercedes-Benz GL.

If you’re looking for distinctive, stand-out styling and solid performance, just hearing the roar of its twin-turbo V-6 will be worth the price for some buyers. While Maserati’s quality hasn’t quite matched rivals, like Porsche, the new Levante would be worth considering for those who don’t want yet another German SUV.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
You may not like this car if you’re watching your budget. Even the base 2017 Maserati Levante starts at $72,000. And neither powertrain package is what you’d label fuel-efficient. Concerns about quality and reliability, a problem with other Maserati models, have to be considered, as well.","After a more than decade-long wait, Maserati is finally delivering its first SUV, the 2017 Levante. For a brand best known for sensually styled sports coupes and sedans, the new Maserati Levante comes as a pleasant surprise, albeit an expensive one, with a fully equipped model nudging into six figures. In traditionally Italian fashion, the SUV’s design is polarizing but distinctive. The overall package strikes a nice balance between performance and practicality, with classic luxury features as well as more modern, high-tech details like its 8.4-inch infotainment screen and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And there’s plenty of performance, whether you opt for the Levante S or the detuned “base” Levante. The new model lives up to its billing as the “Maserati of SUVs.”","Early-on, parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles suggested the SUV would share its guts with the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Wiser Italian heads prevailed, and the...","Favorite Features 
 
360-DEGREE CAMERA
 This surround-view system eliminates the challenges of maneuvering a 16-foot, 4,650-pound SUV in tight spaces, and it gives you the ability to select from several different viewing angles.
 
 SKYHOOK SUSPENSION
 This driver-selectable suspension system keeps you firmly planted, even under aggressive street and track maneuvers, while also improving the 2017 Maserati Levante’s off-road manners.","","Maserati began teasing us with the idea of a performance SUV in 2003 with its, original Kubang concept. The production Levante is a very different animal: Styling is even sleeker than the show car’s, while underpinnings of the Ghibli sedan give it the true soul of an Italian sports car.; Like the Ghibli it is based upon, the 2017 Maserati Levante rides low and wide, enhancing the sense of sportiness. It is more a tall wagon than a true SUV. There’s plenty of glass and that translates into great visibility. The Levante has classic grand turismo looks, with cat’s-eye LED lights, and the familiar Maserati shark nose and concave grille. Those details do more than give it a sporty appearance. The Levante is surprisingly aerodynamic, with a best-in-class drag coefficient of 0.31.","A 360-degree camera with multiple views makes it easy to maneuver Maserati’s SUV in even the tightest parking spots. Even the base Levante offers an extensive array of safety gear, including emergency-braking assist and blind-spot monitor. The base car comes with an acceptable 8-way driver’s seat but we’d prefer to see the 12-way buckets come standard at this price point.","Optional Equipment 
Looking to chill out? Opt for the refrigerated and cooled glove box. It’ll keep that can of Red Bull at the ready when you’re out for some hard driving. The optional Sport Package combines a variety of desirable features, including sport seats, a gloss-black grille, 20-inch wheels, shifter paddles and a sunroof. If you’re looking for the ultimate in style, it’s hard to ignore the optional Zegna Edition, a silk interior fabric package. It adds a distinctive look and feel not offered by any other brand until you’re up into the $300,000 price range.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base 2017 Maserati Levante starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $72,000 plus delivery charges. That jumps to $83,000 for the Levante S and gets you a handful of additional features -- most notably an extra 75 horsepower and 63 more lb-ft of torque. By comparison, you can get into a less well-contented Porsche Cayenne for as little as $59,350, though the German maker also nicks you for all sorts of features that are standard on the Maserati Levante. The Cayenne jumps to $77,250 for the 3.6-liter V-6 Turbo model, and goes all the way up to $117,550 for the V-8 Turbo. The curious can check KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what the Levante is going for in their area. We’ll have to wait to see how resale values hold up after a year or two on the market.

If you need room for up to eight passengers, as well as ample cargo room, the 2017 Chevrolet Traverse crossover SUV still offers one of the roomiest cabins in this field. Its $30,000 entry price is also quite appealing, as is the option of all-wheel drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re seeking the latest in styling and advanced driver-assist features (think adaptive cruise control and collision prevention), a Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer or Toyota Highlander is a better choice. The new 2017 GMC Acadia is also a viable choice for those wishing to remain in the GM family.","With its 3-row seating, spacious cargo bay and handsome styling, Chevrolet’s 2017 Traverse crossover SUV makes an ideal family vehicle. Although it lacks more advanced driver-assist systems found on the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer, the Traverse is still safe, competent and desirable. Mimicking the ride height and family-hauling abilities of the larger Tahoe SUV, the Traverse outmaneuvers its sibling with a more sedan-like ride and better handling. Although the V6-powered Traverse crossover SUV can’t haul or pull like a Tahoe can, it can tow up to 5,200 pounds. Not as fresh or fuel-efficient as some newer competitors, the Traverse still offers such desirable features as 7- or 8-passenger seating, a big cargo hold behind the 3rd-row seat and an exceptionally quiet cabin.","Despite the plethora of newer, nimbler and more fuel-efficient competitors, the 2017 Chevy Traverse remains a remarkably capable crossover SUV.

 SMART SLIDE 2ND-ROW SEAT
 What good is a spacious 3rd-row seat if you can’t easily access it? In the 2017 Traverse, Chevrolet offers the Smart Slide 2nd-row seat that can be operated with just one hand, making it a breeze to get in and out of the rearmost seat.","","Chevrolet’s 2017 Traverse SUV is relatively unchanged from last year, with an all-new 2018 model set to debut next year. Last year’s LTZ is replaced by the Premier trim while a new, lower-priced base LS 1SM is introduced.; The Traverse is now eight years into its current design, but its style is holding up, thanks to front and rear tweaks made a few years ago. The 2017 Chevy Traverse crossover SUV bucks the blocky shape of a traditional SUV with its handsome, rounded (maybe too rounded at the rear) shape. Top-line Premier versions feature exterior mirrors with electronic blind-spot monitoring -- helpful due to the Traverse's size and compromised rear sightlines. Premier models also stand out with dual-exhaust outlets, body-color moldings and chrome accents. Lower trims have a manual liftgate, while higher ones feature a power-operated one.","Beyond its sheer amount of vehicle for the money, the Chevy Traverse offers a good roster of standard features. The LS model gives you keyless entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone connectivity, AM/FM/CD/satellite audio with a 6.5-inch touch-screen display and front and rear USB ports, and 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity. LT trims add a power-driver's seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear park assist, and power liftgate (2LT trim). Top-line Premier models bring leather, dual exhausts and a small bump in power, Bose premium audio, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and blind-spot monitoring with forward collision monitoring.","Optional Equipment 
Options vary across trims for the 2017 Chevy Traverse, but all models can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD) for better traction instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD). Other extras include navigation with traffic data, blind-spot monitoring with a rear cross-traffic alert system (standard on Premier), a power liftgate, 10-speaker Bose audio, rear-seat DVD system, and a dual-panel sunroof. Chevrolet’s MyLink Touch telematics system combines Bluetooth audio streaming, hands-free phone communication, voice recognition, and compatibility with apps such as Pandora. A subscription to the new OnStar 4G LTE system with Wi-Fi is available after the initial 3-month/3-gigabyte trial.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Chevrolet Traverse has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $29,595 for the retail-order-only 1SM and $32,195 for an LS model with no options. 1LT and 2LT models run $34,995 and $37,545, respectively, while the range-topping Traverse Premier begins at $42,940. Adding AWD is an additional $2,000. Fully loaded, a 2017 Traverse can reach over $50,000. The 2017 Traverse’s starting price is slightly higher than competitors such as the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Pathfinder, all of which are also smaller. Buyers merely seeking a bargain 3-row crossover SUV may find it in the Dodge Journey with 7-passenger seating. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As for its resale value, we expect the Traverse to be average.

Whether you desire exotic design, thrilling driving manners or potentially scorching performance, the 2017 Jaguar F-Type checks all these boxes and more. Born as a convertible, the F-Type's open-air manners are intoxicating, while the coupe variant offers more practicality and its own captivating style.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
For all the things we like about the still-fresh F-Type, a potential pitfall remains a reliability history that is unknown at best. If the F-Type's quickly escalating price gives you pause, know that all-new versions of the Porsche Boxster roadster and Cayman coupe start thousands less.","Whether as a coupe or convertible, the 2017 Jaguar F-Type creates a direct connection to the pleasure center of your brain. From the instantaneous acceleration of its supercharged V6 or V8 engines to the primal howl of its exhaust and succulent if cozy 2-seat interior, the F-Type blends performance and couture few others can match. More than just a spiritual successor to the legendary E-Type, the Jaguar F-Type sports coupe and convertible feel like a second coming for the British luxury automaker. Upon debut, eyebrows raised when Jag said the F-Type had the Porsche 911 in its crosshairs, but this rear- or all-wheel-drive sports car quickly proved itself among such elite. For 2017, it pushes the envelope further with the 575-horsepower F-Type SVR.","The 2017 F-Type coupe and convertible offer a variety of spice levels -- and with more than acceptable levels of heat to correspond with your amount of money and nerves....","Favorite Features 
 
THOSE SEXY LOOKS
 Let's be honest: It's not what's under the hood that will attract most people to the F-Type. It's those powerful, svelte, jaw-dropping looks. As sultry in hardtop coupe form as it is as a svelte drop-top convertible, the F-Type is among the sexiest new cars money can buy.
 
 SUPERCHARGED V6
 We've spilled plenty of digital ink gushing about the F-Type's 5.0-liter supercharged V8, but there's plenty to love about the V6. In addition to their significantly lower cost, V6 models are lighter, which makes them feel even more agile. And if you want a rear-wheel-drive F-Type, they're now your only choice.","The driver-focused, 2-person cockpit of the 2017 Jaguar F-Type separates the passenger and driver with a wide console, and provides a left-hand grip for the passenger. It isn't the most spacious place, but even the coupe offers good headroom for taller drivers and adequate legroom, too. The 8-inch infotainment touch-screen's interface conveys what you want to know, but isn't all that intuitive. Even entering basic commands can be frustrating. That gap aside, we like the quality look and feel of the rest of the controls and switchgear. Also note how the center vents rise from the dash when in operation. Nifty.","Rather than aping the 50-year-old lines of the E-Type,","A base Jaguar F-Type is quite well-equipped with leather and suede cloth interior, 6-way manual/power seats, single-zone climate control, and 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with navigation (but no standard rearview camera). Audio bliss is provided by a 770-watt, 12-speaker Meridian system with AM/FM/CD/USB player, HD Radio tuner and Bluetooth connectivity. In addition to 40 more horsepower, F-Type premium models have 14-way-power seats and a panoramic roof on the coupe. Like other new Jaguars, the F-Type comes with EliteCare, which includes five years/60,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Jaguar F-Type offers a long list of options to enhance performance, luxury and safety. Among the offerings -- some standard on higher-trim models -- are dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, heated seats and steering wheel, and power trunk on coupe models. Various performance brakes are offered including fade-resistant carbon-ceramics. F-Type S models have a mechanical limited-slip differential, while V8 F-Types have an electronic active differential. All-wheel-drive models feature torque vectoring for enhanced traction and performance.","Under the Hood 
 
The 2017 Jaguar is offered with two engines and four power outputs. Base and F-Type S models use a supercharged V6 that makes 340 and 380 horsepower, respectively. Both have rear-wheel drive (RWD) as standard, with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional on F-Type S trims. If you want a manual transmission, it will be with this engine and rear-drive only. The F-Type R and SVR use a supercharged V8 that makes 550 and 575 horsepower, respectively. Each is AWD and linked to an 8-speed automatic transmission. In an effort to eke out more efficiency, all F-Types use an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. If you find it intrusive, it can be turned off.

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) has dropped to $62,395. That buys a darn fine F-Type coupe with a manual transmission. The 2017 Jaguar F-Type Convertible drops to $66,395. Add $1,300 if you want an automatic transmission. The F-Type S bows just over $80,000, while an F-Type R begins over $106,000. At the top, the new F-Type SVR begins at nearly $127,000. The F-Type competes with everything from the Porsche Boxster and Cayman to the Porsche 911, which ranges from roughly $90,000 to $200,000. Other rivals are the Chevy Corvette in the mid-$50,000 range to the BMW Z4 and Mercedes-Benz SLC, which also start thousands less than the Jag, but don't bring along as much power or panache. Before buying check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new F-Type. The F-Type's residual value is expected to fare pretty well, though not quite matching Porsche’s.

WAGON, HATCH VARIANTS
 Most buyers associate the BMW 3 Series with a sedan, but BMW's most popular model is also available as a Sports Wagon and a hatchback called Gran Turismo. Both offer extra room and practicality but retain the lively driving manners the 3 Series is famous for.
 
 TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER
 BMW's new turbocharged 2.0-liter is one of the best 4-cylinder engines on the planet. It's smooth and powerful, with 248 horsepower on tap for 0-60-mph blasts under six seconds, and efficient with a fuel-economy rating that reaches 34 mpg on the highway. It's the best of both worlds.","","A new 4-cylinder engine brings new nomenclature; the 330i replaces the 328i. An all-new 6-cylinder engine does the same higher in the lineup with the 335i being replaced by the 340i. There are also trim and color tweaks, including the M Sport Package becoming standard on 340i models.; This is simply one of the most attractive cars on the road. With short overhangs and a low, wide stance, the 2017 BMW 3 Series just looks athletic. It looks like it’s fun to drive. It’s a completely modern design, but there are enough links to previous generations, including the signature twin-kidney grille, that even casual observers know they're looking at a BMW. The more rotund Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the Sports Wagon is universally admired, and the bulging, scooped and flared skin of the macho M3 hints at the potency below its domed hood.","At its most basic, 320i models come with BMW's faux-leather upholstery (SensaTec), manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, USB port, Bluetooth music streaming and HD Radio. Safety features standard on every 2017 BMW 3 Series include eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision. New BMWs also include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost scheduled maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
Options on the 2017 3 Series are extensive and pricey. However, many are worth the investment, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the M Sport Package (now standard on the 340i) help bridge the performance gap between lesser models and the fire-breathing M3. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on many models in lieu of rear-wheel drive (RWD), although not on the M3, and is standard on the wagon and Gran Turismo.","Pricing Notes 
 
The least expensive 3 Series is the 320i sedan with a manual transmission, its Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $35,000, with 6-cylinder 340i variants beginning just under $49,000. The high-performance BMW M3 begins over $65,000. Wagon and Gran Turismo hatchbacks start in the mid-$40,000 range and the plug-in hybrid 330e starts around $45,500. All-wheel drive is available on most models and adds about $2,000. At these levels most 3 Series models are in line with small-luxury-sedan rivals like the Lexus IS, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q50 and the all-new Jaguar XE. For comparison values, check out the Acura TLX, while the Volvo S60 comes with impressive safety features for less money.

With the introduction of the SL450, Mercedes' iconic roadster became attainable for less than six figures, but at nearly $88,000 (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price/MSRP), it's anything but cheap. Prices only scale from there, with the SL550 starting just shy of $112,000 and the AMG SL63 at over $152,000. At nearly $221,000 when factoring in the gas-guzzler fee, the AMG SL65 is among the priciest Mercedes-Benz models you can buy. Thousands more can easily be applied to these figures with options.

If you’re looking for a European luxury sedan that delivers power, styling and exceptional safety, the 2017 Volvo S60 is bound to offer a model to your liking. Extremely competitive pricing is another advantage, as is the Cross Country “go-almost-anywhere” attitude.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The S60’s styling is attractive, but not enough to make it stand out in a crowd. While the S60 R-Design has the handling and muscle to compete, die-hard enthusiasts will find more to like in a BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 or even Cadillac ATS.","The 2017 Volvo S60 isn’t just another fancy midsize-luxury sedan. It’s a truly versatile platform offering consumers a wide range of variation, power and pricing. The base S60 competes well with the Audi A4 and Lexus IS, while the Cross Country is rather unique in that it offers the high ride height of an off-road-ready SUV, only in sedan form. The luxurious 2017 S60 Inscription delivers luxury on par with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and its stretched wheelbase permits an additional three inches of rear-seat legroom. With a starting price undercutting most competitors and a range of powerful yet fuel-efficient turbocharged and supercharged engines, Volvo’s S60 line for 2017 is a tempting prospect worthy of consideration.","While the 2017 Volvo S60 now offers only 4-cylinder engines, don’t be fooled into thinking this is an underpowered economy car. The Drive-E family of turbocharged and turbocharged/supercharged engines runs...","Favorite Features 
 
INSCRIPTION
 Volvo’s S60 Inscription for 2017 offers something many S60 owners have been demanding for some time now: rear-seat legroom. This longer-wheelbase, Chinese-made version adds three inches to the S60’s rear-seat legroom stats, as well as additional luxury features and trim.
 
 PEDESTRIAN DETECTION WITH FULL AUTO BRAKE
 The Swedish penitent for protecting people extends outside the 2017 Volvo S60’s passenger compartment via the car’s pedestrian-detection system. If the driver doesn’t react to the life form crossing ahead, the car will automatically hit the brakes, not the pedestrian.","","Volvo’s 2017 S60 luxury sedan drops its 5- and 6-cylinder engines choices while adding the option of all-wheel drive (AWD) to cars equipped with the 2.0-liter turbocharged Drive-E engine. The S60’s trims are reduced this year to five: Dynamic, Inscription, Cross Country, Polestar and R-Design Platinum.; Lengthening the standard S60 could have gone badly, but the S60 Inscription actually looks quite nice, with the elongated roofline and rear doors nicely proportioned. The 2017 S60 Cross Country, on the other hand, reminds us of the short-lived","Buyers in the upscale-sedan market have high expectations, which the 2017 Volvo S60 handily meets. Being a Volvo, the 2017 S60 starts with safety, including three active systems: City Safety helps avoid low-speed collisions in slow, stop-and-go traffic; Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake senses an impending collision and can brake to reduce the severity of a crash; and Pedestrian Detection with Full Auto Brake that also auto-brakes (see Favorite Features). Inscription models include upscale interior features as well as more room, including a rearview camera, walnut wood inlays, additional sound deadening, a power rear-window sunshade, and silk-metal accents.","Optional Equipment 
Options for Volvo’s 2017 S60 sedan lineup include 19-inch wheels for the Sport Package, which also adds paddle shifters and sporty chassis enhancements. You can add Volvo's Park Assist Pilot to the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) package. A Convenience package adds keyless entry and start, a rearview camera and power-folding exterior mirrors. Not surprisingly, the Swedish automaker also offers a Climate package that adds heated front seats, windshield, steering wheel and windshield-wiper nozzles. The base model offers a harman/kardon navigation audio system while stand-alone options include different-sized wheels and a variety of accessories.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volvo S60 T5 Dynamic starts off reasonably enough with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $35,000. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) Inscription T5 starts at just under $40,000, while the AWD Cross Country starts just over $45,000. It is roughly $1,500 to add all-wheel drive to models not so equipped, but even then the Volvo S60 generally undercuts competitors like the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan, although some Lexus and Infiniti models are more price-competitive. Before buying, be sure to check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to see what others in your area are paying. Based on 5-Year Cost-to-Own, the Volvo S60 is a stellar buy. The low initial purchase price plus low maintenance and repair costs make the Volvo S60 a good choice, and its safety story is, of course, unsurpassed.

Money savvy consumers will appreciate the RX’s excellent resale values and low maintenance costs.","You May Not Like This Car If...

While not as driver-oriented as a BMW X5 or Mercedes-Benz GLE, the 2017 RX 350 and RX 450h hybrid provide more than acceptable levels of acceleration and handling, and still outshine almost every other luxury SUV in the areas of reliability and resale. The RX 350 isn’t as roomy as a Lincoln MKX or Audi Q5, but it’s loaded with advanced safety features optional on most other luxury brands.

Keeping with the rest of the Lexus lineup, it begins with a gaping “spindle” grille up front, fluid headlight housings with LED lights, a high beltline, and the 2017 RX’s most divisive element: a flowing, blacked-out C-pillar behind the rear windows.

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class remains a cut above its competition in sophistication and luxury, making it an excellent choice for anybody wanting a capable, comfortable and confident 2-row luxury SUV. A starting price just over $50,000 makes it surprisingly attainable as well.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Lexus RX offers a softer ride and a price tag that's $10,000 lower; the Acura RDX is agile and comfortable, and even less. The GLE is also limited to five passengers; if you need more room, you'll have to step up to a 3-row SUV like the Mercedes GLS.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is practically a full-fledged lineup of luxury SUVs unto itself. There's the GLE350, with its fuel-efficient V6, or the GLE550e hybrid. On the other end is a GLE63 S AMG with more power than you'll know what to do with, and in between, a new GLE43 AMG model that splits the difference in both price and power. If it sounds like there's a GLE for every luxury SUV taste, then you're right-on, as Mercedes-Benz offers a variation to take on everything from the BMW X5, Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX and Cadillac XT5. Its well-rounded nature, roomy and comfortable interior, and diverse powertrain lineup make it a solid choice for luxury SUV buyers. (The sportier, less practical GLE Coupe has its own review.)","All 2017 GLE models are comfortable and easy to drive, whether it's the base GLE350, or the fire-breathing AMG GLE63 S. That means your choices are dictated by engine, and...","Favorite Features 
 
PLUG-IN HYBRID
 The GLE550e offers up to 18 miles of electric-only travel, along with fast charging, and the gasoline engine means no range anxiety. If your daily drive is limited to those miles, or if you can recharge during the day, you could see a dramatic decrease in your gas bill.
 
 Mercedes-AMG GLE43
 While the 2017 AMG GLE43 is not the quickest or greatest handling AMG model to debut, we like its additional power, upgraded looks, enhanced features and (relatively) affordable price point, allowing AMG-intenders a way into the famed sub-brand, but without a 6-digit price tag.","Last year, the GLE got a major upgrade to its interior, changes that carry through to 2017. All 2017 GLE models are 2-row SUVs that can seat five passengers and carry a respectable 38.2 cubic feet of cargo behind the rear seats. The GLE550e loses a bit of its cargo space thanks to the big lithium-ion battery pack. Regardless, all GLE models offer exceptionally comfortable front seats and equally satisfying rear seats. Like all modern luxury cars there are a lot of features, which means something of a learning curve, but easy enough to find and use after that.","The styling update last year softened some of the lines, but the 2017 GLE exterior remains boxy, but handsome. We particularly like the angled C-pillar behind the rear doors, and the LED taillights make a statement at night, along with the new LED-accented headlights during the day. Opt for the high-end AMG models, and you'll get 20-inch wheels, a lowered stance, and unique styling accents that include four chrome tailpipes. Roof rails on all models add to the GLE's utility factor.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE comes very nicely equipped, as you'd expect from a vehicle starting at more than $50,000. Highlights include a power tailgate, sunroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and selectable drive modes (Comfort, Sport and Slippery). There are also keyless start, a rearview camera, active brake assist and crosswind assist, and Parking Pilot, which assists you in parking your car, either parallel or perpendicular. Audio and communication features include an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio receiver with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, all displayed on an 8-inch color screen. Standard upholstery remains the MB-Tex faux leather.","Optional Equipment 
Even putting aside the different engine options, there's no shortage of upgrades for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class...as long as you're willing to pay. A Premium 1 Package for the GLE350 (standard on higher trims) bundles navigation, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, keyless entry, and the COMAND touch-pad controller. There are also massaging seats, leather, various wood trim designs, and AMG performance packages. Additional safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist, active cruise control and Steering Assist, which keeps the vehicle from drifting in lanes. We're particularly partial to the downright magical-sounding Bang & Olufsen audio.","Under the Hood 
 
At the bottom is a 3.5-liter V6 with 302 horsepower, and is the only model available with rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). All others have Mercedes-Benz 4MATIC AWD standard. The new AMG GLE43 offers a more powerful version of the same V6 engine. V8 power comes in two forms, boasting up to 577 horsepower in the AMG GLE63. The AMG GLE43 comes with Mercedes-Benz's excellent 9-speed automatic; the rest of the lineup comes with the still-excellent 7-speed auto. If fuel economy is your game, the GLE550e offers all-electric propulsion for up to 18 miles.

The base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE midsize-luxury SUV is a little under $53,000 when you include the $925 destination charge; add another $2,500 if you want 4MATIC all-wheel drive. On the other end of the scale is the roughly $110,000 you'll pay for the AMG GLE63 S. And that's all before options; a fully loaded GLE63 S will run you more than $120,000. Despite a somewhat stiff suspension, the AMG GLE43 offers an excellent compromise of power, fuel economy, performance and features, and it starts at about $68,500. Prices closely match the BMW X5, but the Mercedes-Benz is thousands more than vehicles like the Acura RDX, Cadillac XT5, Lexus RX and more. Before buying, complete your homework and check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. The Mercedes GLE's resale value is expected to hold up well over the years, but still trail the Lexus RX.

If you need the towing, hauling and off-road ability only a truck-based SUV can provide, but you’re looking for a premium brand with all the bells and whistles, Lexus’ GX 460 for 2017 certainly deserves a spot on your shopping list.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re simply seeking the tall ride height, roomy cabin and all-weather friendly virtues of a crossover SUV, you’ll find a smoother ride and better handling from an Audi Q7, Infiniti QX60 or even a non-premium SUV like the Mazda CX-9. You’ll also get better fuel economy and safety scores.","Surrounded by newer Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz designs, the 2017 Lexus GX 460 is quickly becoming the odd man out. Its body-on-frame construction makes it capable of tremendous off-road feats, yet also contributes to its rather stiff ride and brutish cornering. Based on the Toyota 4Runner, the GX 460 luxury SUV is jam-packed with Lexus’ best amenities, safety features and technology. Still, competitors such as the Acura MDX, Audi Q7 and Infiniti QX60 offer similar luxury but with a more car-like ride and handling. And while these SUVs can all handle deep snow, gravel roads and muddy trails, none can handle the rough stuff like the 2017 GX 460.","Because of its rigid chassis and off-road-oriented suspension, the 2017 Lexus GX 460 won’t ride or handle like a sporty luxury sedan, and for this it makes no...","Favorite Features 
 
KINETIC DYNAMIC SUSPENSION SYSTEM (KDSS)
 This brilliant setup employs extremely stiff anti-roll bars that minimize lean on paved roads but permit increased suspension travel on the uneven surfaces usually encountered during off-road jaunts.
 
 COMPREHENSIVE FULL-TIME 4-WHEEL DRIVE
 The 2017 Lexus GX 460 has one of the most capable off-road systems available. A Torsen torque-sensing limited-slip center differential includes electronic locking for even power distribution front and rear, while Active Traction Control helps keep all four wheels connected to the terra firma, regardless of surface conditions or weather.","","The 2017 Lexus GX 460 SUV gains a new Sport Design package while 2nd-row captain’s-chair seating becomes standard on the top-level GX 460 Luxury. Heated and ventilated front seats become a stand-alone option.; The GX 460’s tall, square-shouldered shape is clear evidence of its robust off-road intentions; no rounded-over aerodynamic teardrop this. But that tall shape pays dividends. Entry and exit are high, but the doors are big, and ample standard running boards make the step easy. Some may like, some may dislike the rear door; it’s a side-opening arrangement, hinged on the right, which can make loading from curbside awkward and is inconvenient when carrying long stuff home from the lumberyard. On the other hand, for loading luggage or groceries you don’t have to lean in over a swing-down tailgate.","In base form, the Lexus GX 460 is well equipped with synthetic leather interior, wood trim, 10-way-power front seats, dual-zone climate control, rearview camera, power moonroof and power-operated tilt/telescope steering wheel -- always a nice touch. Entertainment and phone connectivity are provided by a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD display audio system with 8-inch touch screen and Bluetooth, dual USB inputs and the new Siri Eyes Free iPhone compatibility. On the safety side, there are 10 airbags, active headrests to reduce the severity of whiplash, and Lexus’ Safety Connect system with 24/7 emergency services.","Optional Equipment 
While the base GX 460 is a good value we recommend the Premium trim; it’s only slightly over $4,000 more but includes leather, 3-zone automatic climate control with interior air filter, mahogany trim, LED foglights and Intuitive Parking Assist. We think that represents reasonable value for the money. Top-line Luxury models include Adaptive Variable Suspension, Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, captain’s-chair 2nd-row seating, power-folding outside mirrors, wood and leather-trimmed heated steering wheel and power-fold-flat 3rd-row seats. Other available options include a 17-speaker Mark Levinson Premium Surround Sound audio system, the Driver Support Package and a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Lexus GX 460 has a base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) right around $52,300; fully loaded, it easily tops $70,000. At its base price, the GX costs more than every likely competitor except the BMW X5, which is slightly higher, so it’s not a bargain item. But it is a quality piece of work, with great fit and finish and a proven record of dependable reliability. We recommend the GX 460 with the Premium package for its value for the money. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the GX 460. While the Lexus starts several thousand dollars higher than most competitors, it holds its value exceptionally well. In fact, in the past it has won the KBB.com Best Resale Value Award for Luxury Mid-Size SUV/Crossover. Inexpensive? No. Great long-term value? Yes.

If you want a 3-row, 7-passenger midsize-luxury SUV that is refined on-road yet extremely capable off-road, the 2017 Land Rover Discovery is your ticket to adventure. A newly available and easily recommendable turbodiesel engine separates the Land Rover from its most able-bodied competitor, the Lexus GX 460.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Starting over $50,000 and rising from there, the Discovery's capabilities don't come cheap. If you want to spend less and don't need serious off-roading equipment, check out the Acura MDX, Volvo XC90 or Infiniti QX60. If you must have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you'll have to look elsewhere or wait.","The all-new 2017 Land Rover Discovery replaces the LR4, the British automaker's 3-row, 7-passenger SUV. In both design and road manners, the rounded and refined Discovery is a big departure from the blocky and more utilitarian LR4. Like the latest Range Rover flagship SUV, the Discovery has shed a massive amount of weight -- nearly 1,000 pounds -- through extensive use of aluminum. Thanks to this weight loss and a supercharged gasoline V6 or newly available turbodiesel, the 2017 Discovery is nimbler, lighter and quieter. What the newest Land Rover hasn't lost is its off-road credibility. With its sophisticated hardware and terrain-management software, the Discovery can venture as far as you dare -- and significantly farther than rivals like the Audi Q7 and Acura MDX.","The 2017 Land Rover Discovery reminds us more of a flagship Range Rover than the outgoing LR4. That's high praise. The Landy's new lightweight architecture makes it feel far more...","Favorite Features 
 
DUAL PERSONALITY
 Land Rovers were born to roam, and the latest is no exception. While it's true most will never touch their off-road potential, the fact remains they can do extraordinary things like wade through nearly three feet of water. The new Discovery is both adventure-ready and a refined on-road family hauler.
 
 TECH TRICKS
 From seats that can fold remotely via a command from your phone to an ingenious tailgate and the ability to let yourself in with the waterproof Activity Key wristband, the new Discovery is filled with smart and satisfying features.","","The 2017 Land Rover Discovery is all-new. This 2- or 3-row; The Discovery’s exterior has switched from a blocky, traditional SUV design to a softer, more rounded one. The new language is clearly in step with the Range Rover and the Discovery's little brother, the Discovery Sport. While the shape has changed, the Discovery is still one tough and functional premium SUV, boasting over 11 inches of ground clearance. One of the LR4's signature design elements -- an asymmetrical, 2-piece tailgate -- is gone, but we welcome the standard power-operated one in its place. Moreover, the Discovery still offers a hidden inner tailgate that can hold up to 600 pounds.","For 2017, the Discovery is available in four trims: SE, HSE, HSE Luxury, plus the limited First Edition. The least expensive Discovery includes a supercharged V6 engine, full-time 4-wheel drive with single-speed transfer case and Terrain Response 2 system, dual-zone climate control, fixed panoramic sunroof, leather interior, 12-way-adjustable front seats, hands-free power tailgate and rear parking sensors. The basic infotainment system includes a 10-speaker, 250-watt audio system, Bluetooth connectivity and 8-inch touch screen. SE and HSE models come with 2-row/5-passenger seating. A 3-row/7-passenger setup is optional. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered (it debuts in the 2018 Range Rover Velar).","Optional Equipment 
We'd recommend at least the HSE trim, with tri-zone climate control, 10-inch high-def infotainment screen, 380-watt Meridian audio, and power inner tailgate. It also opens the door to several option packages and the diesel engine. The HSE Luxury comes with seating for seven, air suspension, 2-speed transfer case, 825-watt Meridian audio, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel and 16-way front seats. Further options include surround camera system, blind-spot monitoring, traffic-sign recognizer, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking. A locking rear differential makes this a serious off-roader. The top-line First Edition is loaded with just about every option.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 5-passenger Land Rover Discovery has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $51,000, including destination. The 7-seat Package, with air suspension and a 2-speed transfer case, is an extra $2,150. The same can be said for the more recommendable HSE model, which begins around $58,000. If you want a diesel Discovery, you'll have to get this trim, then add another $2,000. HSE Luxury models begin closer to $65,000, while the First Edition models are just shy of $75,000. At its starting point, the 2017 Discovery carries a larger price tag than 7-passenger rivals like the Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 and QX60. It is most in line with the rugged Lexus GX, which begins just over $52,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to make sure you're getting the best deal. Since it's all-new, the Land Rover Discovery's resale value is still unknown.

The 2017 Toyota Highlander's emphasis on safety complements its existing strengths of comfort, economy, reliability and resale value. The new engine gets more power and better fuel economy, and the exterior styling is sure to turn heads.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Highlander can haul eight passengers, and it can carry a decent amount of stuff, but it lags competitors like the Honda Pilot in both. Additionally, if you need real off-road capability, or towing capacity greater than 5,000 pounds, check out full-size SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe or Toyota Sequoia.","A thorough refresh keeps the 2017 Toyota Highlander ahead in a very tough game. Under the hood, a new V6 engine puts out more power and connects to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. A new suite of standard safety systems includes active cruise control and automatic collision avoidance, combining with Top Safety Pick + crash-test rating from the IIHS for peace of mind. There's also seating for eight passengers, with decent cargo space behind the third row. The interior design includes tons of clever features to make living with the Highlander easier, and the exterior gets a new grille that's, well, really big. Put it together, and Toyota's midsize SUV will continue to be a best-seller for all the right reasons.","The new V6 under the hood of the 2017 Toyota Highlander puts out more horsepower and torque than its predecessor, and it's now connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission.

DRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
 ""DON'T MAKE ME COME BACK THERE!"" becomes a whisper, thanks to the Highlander's Driver Easy Speak system. This intercom lets your voice be heard loud and clear even in the third row, making driving a shout-free affair, to the benefit of everyone's stress levels (therapeutic screams notwithstanding).
 
 FLIP-UP REAR HATCH WINDOW
 Whether you need to retrieve or add a single item from the cargo area without the dog escaping, or if you just need to grab that pickle jar so it doesn't smash on the pavement when you open the hatch, the Highlander's flip-up rear glass is the gift that keeps giving.","","There's a new face, a new and more powerful V6 engine and a new 8-speed automatic transmission, a new SE model, and a new suite of advanced standard safety equipment for the 2017 Toyota Highlander. The Highlander Hybrid is also available in more trim levels, making it less of a budget-breaker.; The 2017 Highlander's grille is huge, following the big-grille trend that's been stylish for the past few years. Yet it emphasizes the already blunt nose of this midsize SUV, with different models getting different trims, seeming to shrink the headlights in the process. The rest of the Highlander is pretty much untouched, although the new Highlander SE gets a blackout trim package that tones down the grille and ultimately looks pretty good. The styling updates further embolden a design that was already a departure of sorts from the Highlander's bland predecessors, and although the grille won't appeal to everybody, it's certainly distinctive.","The base-model 2017 Highlander LE still comes with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combo good for fuel economy but not much else. However, it also comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense Plus (TSS-P), which bundles high-tech safety gear like active cruise control, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and lane-departure alert and warning. There's 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota's Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.","Optional Equipment 
Most options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.","Pricing Notes 
 
Despite the equipment upgrades, the 2017 Toyota Highlander Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) doesn't change much, with a base 4-cylinder FWD Highlander LE costing about $31,500 including the $940 destination charge; a V6 will add about $2,000 to that price. On the other end of the lineup is the V6-powered Limited Platinum AWD, which runs about $47,200. Then there's the Highlander Hybrid lineup, which now ranges from about $37,200 for the base LE to just under $49,000 for the Limited Platinum version, about $2,600 less than last year. Those prices are in line with competing midsize SUV models like the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder. We think the best value is the nicely equipped mid-level Highlander XLE at about $40,000. Be sure to check your pick against the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note the Highlander has excellent resale value.

Toyota’s 2017 Land Cruiser SUV is unique among full-size SUVs, with a luxurious interior, rugged capability and a near-legendary reputation for quality, reliability and resale. The Land Cruiser joins a very short list of luxury SUVs that can actually overcome tough off-road obstacles.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2017 Land Cruiser’s overall design isn’t as modern as an Infiniti QX80, a Land Rover Range Rover or Mercedes-Benz GLS. The Land Cruiser offers only one engine option, gobbles gas and has a cramped 3rd-row seat. A Chevrolet Suburban or Nissan Armada offers more interior room for less money.","While many luxury SUVs are morphing into soft-riding behemoths with sharply raked rooflines and limited off-road ability, the 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser SUV remains true to its 60-year-old roots. The Land Cruiser’s body-on-frame construction, powerful V8 engine and 8,500-pound tow rating make it one of the more capable full-size SUVs, and its single, well-equipped model formula helps it undercut comparably equipped luxury models like the Mercedes-Benz GLS and Land Rover Range Rover. In fact, so admired is the Land Cruiser that many consider it a luxury SUV on par with Lexus and Infiniti. Unlike the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator, the 2017 Land Cruiser comes with a sophisticated Multi-Terrain 4-wheel-drive setup that includes a low-range transfer case for serious rock crawling.","Peek beneath the 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser luxurious persona and you’ll discover a remarkably capable SUV. Toyota has wisely shunned the move to a lighter, unit-body design, choosing...","Favorite Features 
 
5.7-LITER V8 ENGINE
 A big SUV requires a big engine, and the 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser’s 5.7-liter V8 is one of the best in the industry. With 318 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, the Land Cruiser’s V8 isn’t exactly fuel-efficient, but it is a willing powerplant perfectly suited to meet the most demanding requests.
 
 KINETIC DRIVING SUSPENSION SYSTEM
 By controlling the stiffness of the Land Cruiser’s anti-sway bars, the adaptive Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System permits maximum wheel articulation when off-roading and well-mannered cornering over twisting paved roads.","","The 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser sees no major changes this year.; Toyota adds a bit of flair to the 2017 Land Cruiser’s exterior, with a dynamic front end, power bulge hood, prominent taillights and rear bumper plus handsome 18-inch wheels. The exterior reflects the Land Cruiser's purpose in life, that is, to be ruggedly dependable in any weather, over any terrain, while offering the ultimate in refined luxury. The look emphasizes the capabilities of this luxury SUV with ample ground clearance and short front and rear overhangs for the rough stuff, while adding enough chrome and flourishes to get the front spot at a high-end restaurant's valet parking.","The standard-equipment list for the 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser is surprisingly long, as there's no optional equipment. Standard, full-time 4-wheel drive with a low-range, traction and stability control -- both optimized for off-road capability -- plus the multi-terrain select system. Then there's the luxury, like a 4-zone climate-control system, standard leather upholstery, and an adaptive cruise-control system that employs radar to detect the speed of and distance to the vehicle ahead of it, alleviating part of the stress associated with extended road trips. The Safety Sense-P system, Qi wireless phone charging and Siri Eyes-Free are also included.","Optional Equipment 
None. Seriously, we weren't kidding about everything being standard on the Land Cruiser. Your options are limited to the color of paint on the outside and the tone of leather inside.","Pricing Notes 
 
Bring plenty of money to your Toyota dealership. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Land Cruiser starts just shy of $85,500 including the $1,095 destination charge. That's not cheap, but then again, just about everything is standard equipment. The exception might be paint color, as Toyota charges about $400 for a couple of its different color options. When you consider that the Land Cruiser competes against SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GLS550, Land Rover Range Rover HSE and Infiniti QX80 -- all of which have extensive lists of options driving up the price -- it's not bad. Still, check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2017 Land Cruiser. The Land Cruiser is expected to hold its resale value better than its Mercedes-Benz and Land Rover rivals, and far better than the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator.

If you’re looking for a family SUV with advanced electronics and safety features, plus a wide range of engines and option choices, Ford’s midsize SUV for 2017 is hard to beat. The Explorer’s advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system makes it more off-road capable than a Honda Pilot or Mazda CX-9.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for something that’s easy to maneuver and park, and you don’t need a 3rd-row seat, a smaller SUV like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano or Jeep Grand Cherokee makes a better choice. The Jeep also bests the Explorer both off-road and in towing (7,800 pounds vs. 5,000).","Ford’s 2017 Explorer SUV continues its sales success, with sleek styling, a bevy of trim and package options, and a choice of potent powertrains. The 7-passenger Ford Explorer has plenty of competition, but its Land Rover-like styling and incredibly plush interior place it in line with upscale competitors like the Mazda CX-9 and Hyundai Santa Fe. From the Platinum trim’s twin-turbocharged V6 to the Sport’s beefy wheel and tire package, the 2017 Ford Explorer is one crossover SUV with multiple personalities. Even the most inexpensive base model offers a high-tech 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine, while the available Terrain Management System allows the Explorer to live up to its name both on- and off-road.","When it comes to horsepower, Ford’s 7-passenger Explorer SUV for 2017 delivers at every level. From the standard 290-horsepower V6 to the fuel-efficient 280-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder available in the base,...","Favorite Features 
 
BUTTONS
 With more and more SUVs moving to touch-screen-only interfaces, it’s rather refreshing to see sometimes the old ways are still the best ways. Sure, the 2017 Ford Explorer features a big 8-inch touch screen, but it also has easy-to-reach and -operate controls for the climate and audio.
 
 TERRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 Because Ford’s 2017 Explorer is a crossover SUV, it lacks the rugged body-on-frame design once common to off-road SUVs. To compensate, Ford’s Terrain Management System offers varying settings for the AWD system including snow, sand, mud, grass and gravel.","","With the exception of a new Sport Appearance package for the XLT trim, the 2017 Ford Explorer SUV carries over unchanged.; Last year’s upgrades didn’t alter the Explorer’s basic silhouette, but the details are quite nice. The standard LED low-beam headlights, grille and bumper in front give this mainstream SUV a first-glance resemblance to a","The 2017 Ford Explorer SUV comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport and Platinum. Base models come standard with the 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford's Sync. Ford's MyKey allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.","Optional Equipment 
As is often the case these days, moving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base, XLT and Limited models can substitute the 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder for the standard V6, and AWD is available across the board, regardless of engine. The Platinum model comes with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6, plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash and other luxury items.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Ford Explorer starts around $32,000 for a FWD base model with the standard V6 engine. The 2.3-liter 4-cylinder adds $495 to that total, while the AWD system tacks on $2,200. We think the XLT is a better entry point, at its base price of about $35,000. If you're looking for more power, the AWD Sport and Platinum models start at $46,000 and $54,000, respectively. That's competitive with the Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot, although the Hyundai Santa Fe starts just a few hundred dollars south of $32,000. The KBB.com Fair Purchase Price helps you get a good deal by telling you what other Explorer buyers in your area paid. Note that the Explorer's resale value holds up better than the Dodge Durango, and is right in line with the Chevrolet Traverse and Pilot, even if it's less than the Highlander.

Going head to head against the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes-Benz GLE, the 2017 X5 emphasizes the ""sport"" part of sport-utility vehicle. The resulting lineup of luxury SUV models includes a hybrid, a diesel, and even a fire-breathing M version, all of which are fun to drive. The X5 is big, but still midsize, so it's easy to manage through traffic and parking lots, while remaining roomy and comfortable at the same time.

Most of the changes involve relabeling various option packages, but the X5 now comes standard with touch-screen capability for the iDrive infotainment system, a navigation system updated to iDrive 5.0, and available wireless charging and Wi-Fi hotspots.; From a distance the 2017 X5 looks a lot like its smaller brother, the X3. This is a good thing, because it means that BMW's stylists have cleverly hidden the majority of the BMW's bulk. The twin-port ""kidney"" grille flows into the headlights, there are ""Aero Blades"" channeling air for better aerodynamics, and the design is simply proportioned better than it has ever been. On the practical side, there are roof rails for additional cargo space, and the 2-section tailgate allows you to lift the top half while leaving the bottom closed; the bottom half also doubles as a seat for tailgating.","The basic 2017 BMW X5 sDrive35i comes nicely equipped for the most part, with a noteworthy omission. On the standard-equipment list are 10-way-power and heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, navigation with a 10.2-inch high-res touch screen that's updated to the latest iDrive 5.0 system, a power tailgate, rearview camera, power-adjustable steering column, 9-speaker audio system with HD Radio, and xenon adaptive headlights. However, despite the price you don't get leather seats standard. Spring for the V8-powered X5 xDrive50i model and you get leather, along with 19-inch wheels and luxurious, 20-way-power front seats.

However, BMW has altered things this year, turning the Luxury and M Sport ""lines"" into discrete option packages. The xLine remains though, adding stainless-steel underbody cladding in the front and rear, silver matte grille surround and exterior trim, and an anthracite headliner inside. The M Sport package adds M badges and other sporty-looking trim, while the Luxury package adds chrome exterior accents.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a rear-wheel-drive 2017 BMW X5 sDrive35i is almost $56,500, including the $995 destination charge. Prices climb quickly; all-wheel drive adds another $2,300; the diesel is more than $60,200, and the hybrid comes in at a bit more than $63,000. If you want V8 power you're looking at $73,300 for the xDrive50i, or nearly $100,000 for the X5 M. Options can add thousands of dollars more. Price wise, it splits the difference between the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz GLE and the slightly bigger GLS. However, the Audi Q7, Infiniti QX60 and QX70, Acura MDX, Lexus RX and Porsche Cayenne all start less than the BMW. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that the X5's resale value is on par with Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, better than the Land Rover but still behind the Lexus RX.

If you're looking for V8 power in your midsize SUV because you want to tow, or if you just want a great-looking V6-powered alternative to the Hondas and Toyotas you see everywhere, the Dodge Durango deserves a look and a test drive.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Even with the start/stop V6 engine, fuel economy is not this SUV's strong suit, and even the bigger Chevy Tahoe gets better V8 fuel economy. If that extra capability isn't what you need, the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer or Nissan Pathfinder offers more savings at the pump.","The SUV is to the 21st century what station wagons were to the 20th, thanks to their do-it-all combination of passenger, cargo and towing capabilities. The 2017 Dodge Durango arguably takes it all a step further, offering the big SUV capability one expects in something like a Chevy Tahoe, but in a smaller package designed to compete against the Honda Pilot, GMC Acadia or Toyota Highlander. The 2017 Durango gets a new model level, with the new monochromatic GT replacing the chrome-laden Limited as the volume model. It all adds to a package that offers an available V8, up to 7,400 pounds of towing capacity, and creature comforts like active cruise control with full stop, and a 10-speaker Beats by Dre audio system.","Stick with the standard 295-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine and 8-speed automatic on the 2017 Durango, and you might be pleasantly surprised. It can haul up to 6,400 pounds, but it's...","Favorite Features 
 
DURANGO R/T
 There's no SRT model, but the 2017 Durango R/T comes close. With 360 horsepower from the V8 and a lowered suspension that maximizes grip from the 20-inch wheels and tires, the Durango R/T is one of the most agile SUVs at the price.
 
 ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
 The Durango's comfortable suspension, roomy interior and excellent audio system beg for a road trip, and its available Adaptive Cruise Control -- part of the Technology Package -- makes it even easier by automatically slowing when needed, and even tightening the gap in slower traffic so you don't get cut off.","","The Durango Limited model disappears in favor of the new, monochromatic 2017 Durango GT. Among the interior upgrades are a hand-wrapped soft-touch instrument panel, and Platinum Chrome interior accents. One particularly clever new feature: viewing trailered items while moving using the 8.4-inch Uconnect screen.; In front, the 2017 Dodge Durango boasts LED highlights under the projector-beam headlights, and in back is a cool LED spanning the entire rear end, giving the Durango its signature ""racetrack taillight"" display. The new GT model replaces the Limited's chrome with a monochromatic theme, but fans of the bright stuff can still opt for the SXT or especially the Citadel. The Blacktop package returns on GT and R/T models, featuring 20-inch gloss-black aluminum-alloy wheels, crosshair grille and Durango badges, along with black headlight bezels. R/T models also get more body-colored trim, as well as the R/T's lower ride height.","For 2017 the Dodge Durango SXT comes standard with seating for five passengers, the 3.6-liter V6 engine with start/stop technology, and a Sport mode to enhance the driving experience. There's also the standard Uconnect infotainment system with its AM/FM/CD radio, WMA/MP3 support, Bluetooth, Sirius satellite radio and auxiliary input jack. You also get 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, fog lights, heated power-side mirrors, and 3-zone automatic climate control, along with a tilt/telescope steering column. Different models have different levels of standard equipment, with the top-line Durango getting a power liftgate and sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Durango seems infinitely customizable, from the optional 3rd-row bench and 2nd-row captain's chairs, to V8 power, 4-wheel drive, and more. Beyond that, there's an upgraded 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with navigation, and an LCD multifunction display between the main gauges. Option packages include the Blacktop package, and a Brass Monkey appearance package that features 20-inch bronze wheels. Other options include a rearview camera, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, power sunroof, power hatch and automatic-dimming high beams. If you're going to tow, get the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler, Class IV hitch receiver and load-leveling rear shocks.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base-model, RWD 2017 Durango SXT is about $31,800, which includes the $1,095 destination charge. On the other end of the price spectrum, you can pay more than $46,000 for Durango Citadel with AWD and the new Anodized Platinum package. In between is likely something you'll find affordable and desirable, but note that options can drive the price of a Durango to the low-$50,000 range with the V8 added. V6 models compare well to the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer, and nothing else in the category offers a V8. To get the best Durango deal, be sure to look at the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to learn what buyers in your area are actually paying. The Durango will likely hold its value about as well as a Chevrolet Traverse, but likely fall short of the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer.

If you're looking for a 7-passenger SUV with easy access to the third row, sedan-like driving manners and a strong V6 engine, the 2017 Nissan Pathfinder is a smart choice. New conveniences and active safety features like automatic emergency braking make this year's model more alluring.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need to seat more than seven, check out a Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, or a full-size SUV like the Chevy Tahoe or the freshly revamped Nissan Armada. If you want something more akin to the rugged Pathfinder of the past, look to the current Toyota 4Runner.","With its rough and rugged off-roading ways in the past, the latest-generation Nissan Pathfinder is a sensible, economical and versatile family vehicle. Now based on a sedan-like platform vs. a truck chassis, the 2017 Nissan Pathfinder crossover SUV is more comfortable and more efficient than past iterations. Now in its 30th year, the Pathfinder becomes more appealing for 2017 with a freshening that grants more power and safety features. The Pathfinder competes well against other 3-row midsize SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Chevrolet Traverse, but at seven passengers max the Nissan holds one less than those rivals. That factor aside, the Pathfinder remains a roomy, easy-to-drive family SUV that still boasts light off-road chops and the ability to tow 6,000 pounds.","If you want a 3-row SUV that focuses more on refinement and sedan-like handling, the 2017 Nissan Pathfinder deserves a spot at the top of your shopping list. Thanks to...","Favorite Features 
 
AROUND VIEW MONITOR
 Nissan’s clever Around View monitor places four cameras outside the Pathfinder to create a bird’s-eye 360-degree image, a real help when maneuvering in tight spots. For 2017 it now features moving-object detection, which alerts the driver if the system sees something moving in the vehicle's path while in reverse.
 
 EZ FLEX LATCH & GLIDE SYSTEM
 Another innovative Nissan feature, the EZ Flex & Glide System on the 2017 Pathfinder SUV allows a child seat latched in the second row to remain attached when the seats are slid forward, providing access to the third row with less drama.","","The Pathfinder receives significant revisions for 2017 that include a new front hood and fascia, more power, higher towing capacity, and conveniences like a motion-activated power tailgate. New safety and driving aids include forward emergency braking and active cruise control.; No longer the squared-off utility vehicle it used to be, the latest-gen Pathfinder is more about windswept curves and rounded edges. Some toughness returns with the Pathfinder's 2017 update, however, thanks to what Nissan dubs a ""bold"" new front end with V-Motion grille, a new hood, and new front bumper meant to project a wider stance. Roof rails add functionality, and the optional dual-panel moonroof does a great job opening up the cabin, even for 3rd-row passengers. The power-operated tailgate that's standard on higher trims is now motion-activated, meaning it can be opened with the swipe of a foot.","The Pathfinder remains available in four trims: S, SV, SL and Platinum. The least expensive 2017 Pathfinder S model comes with a V6 engine, tri-zone climate control, 8-inch touch-screen display with rearview camera display, push-button ignition, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, and 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Thankfully even a base Pathfinder now includes Bluetooth wireless connectivity, plus a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with two USB inputs and HD Radio. In addition to airbags all around and traction- and stability-control systems, one notable safety feature is the Easy Fill Alert that beeps the horn when you fill the tires to the correct air pressure.","Optional Equipment 
Stepping up from Pathfinder S to SV is recommendable for both its standard features and many options. Included are 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, automatic headlights, auto-dimming rearview mirror, rear sonar parking assist, while this model is available with navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and 13-speaker Bose audio system. SL models come with the Around View monitor, power tailgate, blind-spot monitoring, leather interior and heated front seats and steering wheel. Top-line Platinum models include intelligent cruise control, forward emergency braking, navigation, panoramic moonroof and 20-inch wheels. A trailer towing package is available on all models except the base S.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Nissan Pathfinder crossover SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $30,890 for a base S version. Stepping up to the more recommendable Pathfinder SV trim is $33,580. Go full-boat on a loaded, all-wheel-drive Pathfinder Platinum and you can top $46,000. These prices are similar to those of the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Hyundai Santa Fe. The Pathfinder's starting price undercuts that of the Ford Explorer but is higher than the Kia Sorento. The Dodge Journey and Mitsubishi can also be had for less, but aren't as recommendable. As a smart shopper, you know to first check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Nissan. The Pathfinder's residual value is expected to hold up well but not quite match that of a Toyota Highlander.

If you’re looking for a compact SUV that has more heft and presence than most small crossover SUVs, GMC’s 2017 Terrain might pique your interest. With an available V6, it has plenty of power and can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Its interior amenities are also very upscale.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The 2017 GMC Terrain compact-crossover SUV might look rugged, but it’s not designed for serious off-road use. The interior is smaller than the Forester or Santa Fe Sport and it lacks some newer collision-avoidance technologies.","GMC’s compact Terrain SUV for 2017 combines rugged good looks with a practical size and good fuel economy. Draped in GMC styling cues, the Terrain plays in the same league as the Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. However, unlike these worthy competitors, the Terrain offers the option of a V6 engine and a more upscale interior. Load up a Denali trim and the Terrain’s price tag quickly moves into Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Ford Escape Titanium territory. The Terrain’s unit-body construction permits it a modern suspension that delivers a comfortable ride and sedan-like handling, and with available all-wheel drive (AWD), year-round driving confidence. Regrettably, the Terrain’s soft suspension and relatively low stance exclude it following the Subaru Forester or Jeep Cherokee off-road.","If a comfortable cabin and quiet ride are high priorities, few compact-crossover SUVs compare to the 2017 GMC Terrain.

DISTINCTIVE EXTERIOR
 GMC’s distinctive exterior styling is applied in full force to the compact 2017 Terrain SUV, giving it a bold, boxy look quite the contrast to vehicles like the Mazda CX-5, Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. We particularly like the new Nightfall package in Onyx Black.
 
 MOVABLE 2ND-ROW SEATS
 GMC’s Terrain compact SUV for 2017 includes a sliding 2nd-row seat that can move fore or aft a full eight inches. When the rear seat isn’t occupied, moving it fully forward can help create much needed cargo space.","","The 2017 GMC Terrain compact SUV gets a new Nightfall package featuring monochromatic treatment and unique wheels in four colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, Graphite Grey and Crimson Red.; If you think an SUV should look tough, then the","The 2017 GMC Terrain compact SUV has a bare-bones SL trim, but we prefer the SLE models that add 17-inch wheels, a rearview camera, color touch-screen radio, heated outside mirrors, USB port with iPod support, Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, XM Satellite Radio, and OnStar with 4G LTE connectivity that can be shared (for a fee) as a Wi-Fi connection. We like the additional quiet thanks to the active noise-cancellation system, and the rear seat features sliders that move back and forth eight inches to help with legroom.","Optional Equipment 
The two most noteworthy options for GMC’s 2017 Terrain crossover SUV are the 3.6-liter V6 engine and all-wheel drive. But there's more. Upper trim levels add leather seating and a navigation system, and on SLE-2, SLT and Denali trims, active safety features like forward-collision alert, blind-spot detection and lane-departure warning. A 2nd-row entertainment system with two independent screens will keep the kids occupied on long trips. Other options include a 10-gigabyte music-storage hard drive, Pioneer audio and a programmable rear liftgate that can be set to open at a desired height.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 GMC Terrain SL's Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starts at about $25,000, including destination, while the SLE-1 starts just over $28,000. Mid-level SLE2 and leather-clad SLT SUV models start at about $29,700 and $32,000, respectively. The Terrain Denali starts around $35,200. AWD adds about $1,750 on all models. While the Denali certainly has flash, you can get most of the same equipment on the mid-level SLE2 and SLT models, and save quite a bit of cash. Notable competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, all of which cost less than the Terrain, but come with less standard equipment. Be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to see what others are paying in your area, and note that the Terrain should hold its value well over the years, better than the Dodge Journey, but still behind the segment residual leader, the Honda CR-V.

If you’re seeking a 3-row luxury SUV that features sporty handling, a unique look plus a full range of technology and driver-assist features, Infiniti’s QX60 for 2017 checks all the right boxes. Attractive pricing makes the QX60 more appealing than similarly equipped models from Mercedes-Benz or BMW.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want more than 300 horsepower under the hood, you’ll need to look to the BMW X5 or Mercedes-Benz GLS. Those needing lots of cargo space or the ability to tow more than 5,000 pounds might be better off with a larger Cadillac Escalade or Infiniti QX80.","The 2017 Infiniti QX60 luxury SUV offers buyers all the style, comfort and power for which Infiniti is known, then tops it off with impressive safety technology, a sumptuous interior and room for seven passengers. The 3-row QX60 offers sportier handling than the softer-sprung Buick Enclave or Audi Q7, yet this same advantage can become a detriment over less-than-perfect pavement. Stern ride aside, the QX60 offers a powerful V6 engine, choice of front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD) and styling that truly stands out from other luxury SUVs. The QX60 Hybrid offers slightly better fuel economy with similar performance, but as gasoline looks to remain cheap for the near future, we’re not certain the extra cost and technology are worth the added premium.","Ride comfort is always a subjective topic, but in the 2017 Infiniti QX60 luxury-crossover SUV we can safely attest this is a vehicle for those who prefer sharp handling and...","Favorite Features 
 
PREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING
 While many cars offer collision warning and intervention systems, the 2017 Infiniti QX60’s system has the ability to look at the car beyond the one in front of you, thus anticipating situations in which the driver directly ahead will likely respond.
 
 DISTANCE CONTROL ASSIST
 Bumper-to-bumper traffic is now a part of everyday life, which is why the QX60’s Distance Control Assist can make the drive a little less stressful. Should you become momentarily distracted, DCA keeps an appropriate space between your car and the car ahead, eliminating the possibility of a minor fender-bender.","","The 2017 Infiniti QX60 gains gasoline direct injection for an additional 30-horsepower bump. A motion-activated power liftgate joins the options list, as do an improved rear-seat entertainment system and Wi-Fi.; The 2017 Infiniti QX60's rounded, sleek design has been recently updated with redesigned headlights and grille, and new fog-light surrounds. The side view shows a gently sloping roof, but that design doesn’t negatively affect the QX60's impressive interior room. One of the key styling cues of the QX60 is the bowed window frame at the back of the side windows. A smaller version of this design detail can also be seen on Infiniti's stunning Q60","Buyers expect a luxury SUV to come equipped with a bevy of standard features. And even the least expensive QX60 is nicely appointed, with features like heated, power-folding side mirrors; moonroof, and a power liftgate. Inside, all QX60s come with a leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, tri-zone temperature control, Bluetooth and USB ports, power tilt/telescoping steering column, rearview camera with 7-inch screen and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio. Some optional features in the regular QX60 are standard in the Hybrid, which also has a system that emits a sound to notify pedestrians that the otherwise hushed vehicle is there.","Optional Equipment 
You can choose gas or hybrid, and front- or all-wheel drive, but many of the other options are bundled into packages. Navigation is optional, as are a 15-speaker Bose audio system, heated seats in the second row, a motion-activated power liftgate, Wi-Fi, auto high beams, heated steering wheel, a moonroof over the second and third rows and a rear-seat entertainment package. There are also a lot of available safety features, including blind-spot monitoring, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, and systems that can automatically apply the brakes when traveling in both forward and reverse.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Infiniti QX60 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $44,000 when equipped with a V6 and front drive, while the QX60 Hybrid begins at just over $53,000. Loaded with options, the QX60 can reach close to $60,000, and the hybrid SUV can top $63,000. At its starting price, Infiniti's 3-row luxury SUV is directly in line with the Acura MDX and more than $10,000 below such rivals as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5. To find out what others in your area are paying for the 2017 QX60, check out the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price. Like the Audi, the QX60's resale value is expected to be very good.

Exclusivity and capability are Land Rover hallmarks, and with its available diesel engine and 7-passenger seating, it even nods toward practicality. On the other hand, equip it with the supercharged V8, and the Range Rover Sport gives the Porsche Cayenne a run for its money.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Range Rover Sport isn't the only game in town, and if you're seeking an SUV with luxury, capability and status for a lower price, there are the Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class and BMW X5. Also note that reliability is not a Land Rover strong suit.","The square-edge styling of the 2017 Land Rover Range Rover Sport simultaneously communicates two competing ideas. First, you are in the presence of an expensive luxury machine literally fit for kings and queens. And second, Her Royal Highness likes to go bushwhacking. Amazingly, the Range Rover Sport is equally good at both tasks. The interior marries wood, leather and other high-quality materials in a way that could only be British, resulting in passenger coddling that perfectly justifies the high price tag against competitors like the Audi Q7 or BMW X5. Yet even though most Range Rover Sports will never set a tire off pavement, if the going does in fact get rough, this luxury SUV is one of the best off-road vehicles in the world.","We've had the rare opportunity to test both elements of the Land Rover Range Rover Sport in none other than England itself. An off-road trail let us...","Favorite Features 
 
TORQUE VECTORING
 If you get your 2017 Range Rover Sport with a V8 engine, you also get a unique torque-vectoring setup that provides more power to the rear outside wheel when turning. This makes for tighter turns when off-roading, and quicker, smoother turns on dry pavement.
 
 3.0-LITER TURBODIESEL ENGINE
 There's more to the Range Rover Sport's diesel engine than just fuel economy. It offers up 440 lb-ft of torque, almost as much as the V8 models, for excellent acceleration. And, yes, its 25-mpg combined fuel-economy rating is very good for a vehicle this size.","Not only are the interior materials and assembly first-rate in the 2017 Range Rover Sport, there are enough variations in materials that you can virtually customize your interior. Almost everything is swathed in premium leather; what isn't is either wood, carbon fiber, metallic trim, or plastics of a high enough quality that you'll hardly notice they're plastic. The simplicity of the design is part of its success. The simple layout makes the Range Rover Sport feel less hectic inside, while still offering all the phone and audio connectivity you could want in a modern luxury SUV.","The 2017 Range Rover Sport is undeniably a Land Rover product from the outside, thanks to the slab sides, electric-razor grille, and now-signature thin headlights. But it all works beautifully, the elements combining into an elegant and luxurious whole, with a road presence that’s hard to match. Different models sport different trim -- there's more shiny trim on the Autobiography, for example, than on the 550-horsepower SVR model -- and paint options can cost thousands of dollars. One of our favorite little touches is the cool approach lighting that casts a wide beam in the shape of the Range Rover Sport’s silhouette.","The base-model Range Rover Sport SE comes standard with a leather interior and 14-way-power front seats, air suspension, multi-mode selectable Terrain Response, 60/40-split rear seat, front/rear parking sensors, and new this year, a 10.2-inch InControl touch-screen infotainment system. Also included is Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, remote-sensing unlocking and push-button start, and an Automatic Access Height lowers the vehicle’s air suspension when placed in Park. All that, along with dual USB ports and a hard-disk navigation system, makes one wonder what else there is to add. Well...","Optional Equipment 
There are multiple engine options from supercharged V6 and V8 engines to a turbocharged V6 diesel, as you work your way from SE, through HSE, to Supercharged and ultimately Autobiography and SVR models. The top-line 2017 Range Rover Sport SVR comes with a 550-horsepower supercharged V8 engine, plus adaptive cruise-control, ""automatic"" parallel parking, advanced blind-spot monitoring, traffic-sign recognition, a surround-view camera system and a full LCD instrument panel. For off-road capability, there are a 2-speed transfer case, All-Terrain Progress Control, torque vectoring and Terrain Response 2 Auto. For luxury, consider a panoramic moonroof, 3rd-row seat and 1,700-watt, 23-speaker Meridian audio system.","Under the Hood 
 
There is V6 and V8 power available for the 2017 Range Rover Sport, all of them either supercharged or turbocharged. Toward the bottom end is a 340-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6, which is also available in a more powerful 380-horsepower version. The 254-horsepower 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 makes a whopping 440 lb-ft of torque, nearly as much as the V8 engines. About those, there's a 510-horsepower 5.0-liter V8, or a high-performance version that puts out 550 horsepower in the Range Rover Sport SVR. All of the engines come with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission, and all Range Rover Sport models come standard with 4-wheel drive. While the V8 engines obviously win on power, the V6 versions actually offer plenty of power.

 502 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-5,500 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/19 mpg
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base-model 2017 Land Rover Range Rover Sport SE is right at the $66,500 mark; add about $2,000 if you want a diesel with that. On the other end of the spectrum is the Range Rover Sport SVR, which starts at more than $112,000, and with options the price can climb to more than $130,000. While that's more expensive than competition like the BMW X5, Acura MDX and Audi Q7, it is in line with vehicles like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X6, although neither of those offers a third row. Before you set out to purchase your Range Rover Sport, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Note that resale value for the Range Rover Sport isn't expected to reach the long-term standards set by Audi, Lexus, and BMW.

If your heart yearns for something sporty but reality necessitates an SUV, the 2017 Mazda CX-9 will satisfy both. In addition to having the kind of athletic manners that would cost tens of thousands more in a luxury SUV, the CX-9 boasts premium looks and features that belie its mainstream badge.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The CX-9 only seats seven, so you'll have to pick a roomier rival like the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot or Chevrolet Traverse if you need to fit eight. If you're adamant about having a V6 engine or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, you'll also have to choose one of the Mazda's competitors.","Reborn last year into a svelte new form with premium appeal, the 2017 CX-9 is Mazda's largest and most powerful SUV. With three rows and seating for seven, the Mazda CX-9 is in the same category as midsize-crossover SUVs such as the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer. But one spin in Mazda's flagship SUV proves it's in a different league when it comes to road manners. Simply put, the Mazda CX-9 is the most fun-to-drive SUV in its class. As with other Mazdas, the CX-9 isn't the segment's most powerful, but its taut handling and turbocharged engine imbue this crossover SUV with athletic flair. The flip side of the equation comes in practicality, as the CX-9 has less room for kids and cargo.","Mazdas have a knack for being Davids among Goliaths, out-handling and out-maneuvering more powerful rivals. That applies even to Mazda's biggest vehicle. Compared to competitors, the CX-9 feels lighter on...","Favorite Features 
 
PREMIUM APPEAL, MAINSTREAM PRICE
 If you want more proof of the blurred line between mainstream and luxury, look at the Mazda CX-9. Specifically, look at the roughly $45,000 Signature edition. Yes, those are real rosewood-and-aluminum accents surrounded by Nappa leather. Also included are Mazda's suite of active safety features and a premium Bose audio system.
 
 HIGH TORQUE, HIGH EFFICIENCY
 Though smaller in size, the CX-9's 4-cylinder turbo engine puts up impressive figures. Among them: 310 lb-ft of torque that enable prompt initial acceleration and 28 mpg, the highway fuel economy on front-wheel-drive (FWD) models.","","All-new last year, the 2017 Mazda CX-9 carries over with few changes. Among them, the Smart City Brake Support -- an automatic emergency braking system -- becomes standard on Touring trims.; With last year's revamp, this 2nd-gen Mazda CX-9 received a svelte new suit. Dressed in Mazda's ""Soul of Motion"" design philosophy, the CX-9's sheet metal emphasizes sweeping forms, organic shapes, and the idea of movement even at rest. We think it's beautiful. That big grille up front adds to the premium cred, yet doesn't seem overboard. The tapering roof and forward stance make this SUV appear smaller than it is, and even its rear is pretty thanks to a horizontal treatment of the taillights and rear lip beneath the window. A pair of exhaust outlets further emphasizes this SUV's sporty nature.","The 2017 Mazda CX-9 remains available in four trims: Sport, Touring, Grand Touring, and the top-shelf Signature. Even the base Sport model offers amenities like 3-zone climate control that includes a 2nd-row control panel, 7-inch color touch-screen display with rotary controller, rearview camera, and 18-inch wheels. However, unless you opt for a package, you'll still have to manually adjust the front seats. Standard tech features include the Mazda Connect system with voice command, Internet radio streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and AM/FM/HD Radio with an auxiliary input and two USB inputs. Sorry, CD fans -- a compact disc player isn't even optional.","Optional Equipment 
We recommend at least the Touring trim, which includes heated and power-operated front seats, leather trim, power liftgate with adjustable height setting, a larger 8-inch command screen, blind-spot monitoring, and four USB ports. This year, the Touring trim comes with a significant active safety system: Smart City Brake Support. Grand Touring trims include navigation, 12-speaker Bose audio, a moonroof and more safety/driving aids such as radar cruise control, backup sensors and lane-keeping assist. Signature models have all-wheel drive (AWD) standard (it's optional on all other models) and Nappa leather trim, genuine rosewood accents, and nifty LED accent lighting in the grille.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mazda CX-9 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $32,460 for a base model. Touring trims bow at $36,910, and Grand Touring models start at $41,410. Adding AWD is an extra $1,800. The top-line Signature model that includes AWD standard starts at $45,255. At these prices, the new CX-9 begins slightly higher than rivals like the Highlander, Pilot, Traverse, GMC Acadia and Kia Sorento. But the price-to-features differential evens out or leans in the Mazda's favor as you climb trims. If you're simply looking for a low-priced 3-row SUV, there's the Mitsubishi Outlander, though that isn't as easy to recommend. Even harder, but it still exists, is the Dodge Journey. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new SUV. The Mazda CX-9's resale value is expected to hold up well, though still trail the Highlander and Pilot.

"https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/gle-coupe/2016/","2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe","8.9","9.1","8.3","8.8","8.0","N/A","You'll Like This Car If... 
If you want the characteristics of an SUV – all-wheel drive, taller ride height and improved cargo capacity – blended with the design cues and performance attributes of a luxury-sports sedan, the Mercedes GLE Coupe is worth a look.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The GLE Coupe's unique design and athletic performance come at a cost. Beyond its $66,000-plus starting price – $14,000 above the standard GLE – the Coupe has less interior room, worse outward visibility, and the choice of only two powertrains. As for its looks, we're being polite in calling it ""unique.""","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is the sporty counterpart to the standard GLE SUV. And though its name differs by only one word, the Coupe variant is far different. Like its rival the BMW X6, the GLE Coupe trades the practicality of the vehicle on which it's based for a sweeping design and athletic performance. Also similar to the X5-drived X6, Mercedes insists on using the word ""Coupe"" despite this vehicle's four doors and taller, SUV-like stance. The GLE Coupe further distinguishes itself from the GLE by offering only two turbocharged gasoline engines, a V6 or voracious V8 in the high-performance GLE63 S Coupe. As with its BMW rival, the Mercedes GLE Coupe caters to luxury buyers who prioritize design and individuality over everyday practicality.","With only two models, the GLE Coupe's manners are less varied than that of the standard GLE, whose lineup spans from a diesel-powered SUV to a gas-electric hybrid....","Favorite Features 
 
AMG GLE63 S 
One could make that case that if you have the means to indulge in the less-practical GLE Coupe, you may as well spend over six figures for the top-line version. While testing this beast in twisting, high-speed roads in Germany, we couldn't help smiling at its ridiculous power and grip. 
 
MASSAGING FRONT SEATS 
Few automotive options say indulgence quite like massaging front seats, and Mercedes makes some of the finest. The front pair in the GLE Coupe allow for adjustment of intensity, placement and more, all of which can reduce fatigue and promote relaxation.","Like the standard GLE, the Coupe has a 5-passenger, 2-row layout. However, the GLE Coupe's interior isn't as roomy, a result of its downward sweeping roof and curvy vs. boxy shape. At 23 cubic feet, cargo capacity behind the rear seats isn't terrible, but it's far less than the 38-plus found in the GLE. True to its name, the GLE Coupe is more comfortable for a pair of well-heeled passengers than, say, a family of five. Fit/finish is Mercedes-elegant, but rear visibility is hampered, and adjustments for some amenities like multi-way-power seats require going through awkward on-screen sub-menus.","If there is any confusion between the Coupe and the standard GLE, it takes but a glance to see they are vastly different. Whereas the GLE retains the blocky, rugged good looks of the Mercedes M-Class SUV it replaces, the all-new GLE Coupe is all curves. Its profile is similar to the X6, with a downward-sweeping roofline that limits cargo space inside and compromises outward visibility. Nonconformist automotive design has long led to such compromises, but we're not sure the tradeoffs are worth it for the GLE Coupe. Its rear can appear bulbous and its overall shape awkward. You be the judge.","As expected from a high-end Mercedes-Benz, the GLE450 AMG Coupe comes with a bevy of premium amenities. Included are heated and power-operated front seats (base material is still the MB-Tex faux leather, though), power liftgate, power-adjustable steering wheel, navigation, rearview camera, dual-zone climate control and 21-inch wheels. Standard infotainment includes an AM/FM/CD/DVD system with Bluetooth streaming, USB/SD inputs and HD Radio and Mercedes' COMAND touch-pad control system and 8-inch display. The AMG GLE63 S adds a brawny V8, Nappa leather seating, active parking assist, blind-spot monitoring, panorama roof, harman/kardon premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats and surround-view/rearview camera.","Optional Equipment 
As is customary for Mercedes, the list of options and packages for the new GLE Coupe crossover SUV is extensive and expensive. Extras range from a Convenience package with soft-close doors and heated/cooled cup holders to those massaging seats we raved about in Favorite Things. Optional safety and driving aids include active lane-keeping assist, dynamic cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. In addition to the harman/kardon premium audio system that is standard in the GLE63 S and optional in the GLE450 AMG, an ultra-premium Bang & Olufsen system is available.","Under the Hood 
 
A choice of two turbocharged gasoline engines is available for the 2016 GLE Coupe, and which you get depends on trim. The GLE450 AMG Coupe uses a V6, while the AMG GLE63 S packs a voracious V8. The GLE450 uses a 9-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 GLE Coupe is linked to a 7-speed. Both models are 4Matic, which is Mercedes' lingo for all-wheel drive (AWD). In this case the AWD isn't for rugged off-roading but for enhanced traction in foul weather and better performance in general. Towing may not be top of mind in a GLE Coupe, but a Class III trailer hitch is available to make use of this Mercedes' 7,200-pound tow capacity. 
 
3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 
362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm 
384 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-4,000 rpm 
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/23 mpg 
 
5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 
577 horsepower @ 5,250-5,750 rpm 
561 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-5,250 rpm 
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/18 mpg","Pricing Notes 
 
With a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting over $66,000, the 2016 Mercedes GLE Coupe is priced $14,000 beyond the standard GLE SUV. The gap between the two Coupe models is even wider, with the AMG GLE63 S beginning at over $110,000. Go full-boat, and the GLE63 S can stretch beyond $120,000. At these prices, the GLE Coupe is priced higher than its main rival, the BMW X6. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Mercedes SUV. As it is an all-new, niche model, the GLE Coupe's resale value in the years ahead is still an unknown.

If you need to tow 7,500 pounds and want 7-passenger capacity in a luxury SUV that doesn't share its underpinnings with a lower-end brand model -- looking at you, Cadillac Escalade and Lexus LX -- then the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a compelling choice.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The GLS is very accommodating, but competitors offer more towing capability -- like the Escalade, Lincoln Navigator and Infiniti QX80 -- and others offer many of the GLS's features for less money, like the GMC Acadia and Jeep Grand Cherokee.","Since the S-Class is the Mercedes-Benz flagship sedan, it makes sense to re-brand its full-size SUV the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. The ""S"" is a little superfluous though, as the big Benz SUV is already a well-known leader when it comes to luxury, power and prestige. Whether you choose the eco-friendly diesel-powered GLS350d (delayed release), the pavement-devouring AMG GLS63 and its twin-turbo V8, or one of the models in between, there's little to deter anybody of means from considering this big Benz. The 2017 GLS also gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission (except for the AMG), air suspension, revised exterior styling and an updated interior. It all adds to an already extensive list of standard equipment, and at a price that's surprisingly fair for a prestigious luxury vehicle.","We drove the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class in Austria both on and off the pavement.

 This is an excellent diesel engine, offering smooth, quiet and clean power in the 2017 GLS350 BlueTEC. It offers more torque than many V8 engines, but still gets very good fuel economy.
 
 SURROUND VIEW SYSTEM
 There's no getting around the fact that the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a big SUV, but getting around in a GLS-Class is easier thanks to the available Surround View system, which gives you a 360-degree bird’s-eye view of your surroundings.","","In addition to the new name, the 2017 GLS-Class gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission, available air suspension, a revised exterior and a new interior. Also available are new Designo interior and exterior treatments.; There's no mistaking the 2017 GLS-Class as anything but a Mercedes-Benz. While the styling updates don't amount to an all-new vehicle, they certainly give it an appearance that's more in line with the current design themes seen in other Mercedes vehicles. The grille, headlights and bumper in front are all-new, and resemble the smoother shapes we've seen on the smaller GLC-Class. In back, new LED taillights are larger and more modern, and the rear side glass has been subtly reshaped as well. New Designo paint schemes are available, as well as a range of different alloy wheels.","As befitting a luxury SUV with a starting price of nearly $70,000, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class comes very nicely equipped. Included are cruise control, a power driver's seat with memory, remote start, a rearview camera, and a power tailgate and power-folding mirrors. Dual-zone climate control is also standard, as is an audio system with a 6-disc CD/DVD changer and standard Bluetooth audio streaming. Mercedes' remote application mbrace is also standard, and comes with five years of complimentary service. Safety features include crosswind stabilization and systems that monitor for driver drowsiness or an impending collision.","Optional Equipment 
Options largely are grouped into different packages. For example, the Driver Assistance Package adds blind-spot alert, brake assist, Pre-Safe anti-collision system, active cruise control and active lane keeping. A Premium package adds illuminated doorsills, push-button ignition, plus navigation and other features available in other option packages. An Active Curve System package adds adaptive shocks, and a curve-system stability control that is just about as close to autonomous driving as Mercedes's lawyers will let the engineers get. Individual options include leather seats with super-soft Nappa leather, and an upgraded Bang & Olufsen surround-sound system that's a must for audiophiles.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS350d starts at a lofty-but-reasonable $69,000 when you include the $925 destination charge. The GLS450 starts at about $71,500, while the GLS550 comes in at just under $96,000. None of that is cheap of course, but then again, this is a Mercedes-Benz. Besides, the prices are competitive against the likes of the Cadillac Escalade and Range Rover Sport, and even when you start adding options and push the price of the GLS550 to more than $100,000, it's still on par with the BMW X5, Audi Q7 and Lexus LX 570. Prices for the AMG GLS63 haven't been set yet, but expect it to be around $122,000 before options. Check the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to see what others in your area paid for their GLS, and expect to have very good resale value, especially with diesel models.

The 2017 Lincoln MKT’s polarizing styling isn’t as fresh or modern as some newer luxury-crossover SUVs, and rear-seat headroom can be tight for taller passengers. The MKT is a big SUV, making parking and maneuvering a bit more difficult than in a smaller, 5-passenger crossover SUV.","Providing that the 2017 Lincoln MKT luxury SUV’s bulbous proportions, old-style Lincoln winged grille and unique rear styling aren’t turnoffs, you might actually find quite a bit to like in this 7-passenger crossover SUV.

 With 365 willing horses on tap, the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 is the perfect match to the 2017 MKT’s luxury SUV’s size and stature. For an additional $4,500 over the base model, the EcoBoost MKT also comes standard with AWD, more luxury features and almost no penalty at the pump.
 
 INNOVATIVE INTERIOR
 Lincoln’s MKT for 2017 may be stylistically awkward on the outside, but its interior is to die for. Handsome seats and door panels complement an easy-to-operate dash and control layout. Options include a 2nd -row console refrigerator and power-folding 3rd-row seats.","","Lincoln’s 2017 MKT luxury-crossover SUV carries over with no major changes of note.

There's also a power tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, which combines with power-adjustable pedals to let drivers find a comfortable driving position. The standard audio system offers 10 speakers and AM/FM/CD/aux inputs, all controlled via the touch-based Sync 3 system and 8-inch screen. EcoBoost models get standard all-wheel drive and Lincoln Drive Control adjustable chassis dynamics, plus other standard equipment.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 MKT can be loaded up with luxury trim simply by moving up to the EcoBoost-equipped model. Items such as a heated steering wheel, navigation system, THX II audio, and a dual-screen DVD rear-seat entertainment system are all present. Also available are 2nd-row bucket seats and a refrigerator to go between them, a panoramic vista roof and a power-folding third row. One particularly cool tech feature is Lincoln's Active Park Assist, which performs the bulk of parallel parking for the driver. Safety options include adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, a blind-spot monitoring system and inflatable seatbelts in the second row.","Pricing Notes 
 
A base-model front-wheel-drive 2017 Lincoln MKT carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) tag just under $44,500, including destination charges. The extra power of the EcoBoost engine -- and you should spring for it -- will have you paying about $4,500 more, but it comes standard with the added safety of all-wheel drive and more luxury features. If you pile on the options you'll top out right around $60,000. That's between such luxury SUV models as the Buick Enclave, Infiniti QX60 and Acura MDX on the lower end, and the BMW X5 and Audi Q7 on the high end. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the MKT. In the long term, we expect the MKT's resale value to be lower than that of its competitors.

Once an army of one, the X6 has been cloned by such notables as the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe. Frankly we’re somewhat puzzled by the X6’s appeal. It isn’t a very off-road-capable vehicle and comes up short in areas designated for cargo and passengers. The 2017 BMW X6’s size precludes it from being as sporty as an Infiniti QX30 or Lexus NF, and yet despite these many drawbacks, the X6 is remarkably fun to drive and seems to have gained a loyal following.","Despite its hulky, oddly proportioned exterior, the 2017 BMW X6 SUV is an impressive performer. The all-wheel-drive grip and 445-horsepower twin-turbocharged V8 in the xDrive50i is particularly alluring, especially in...","Favorite Features 
 
10.2-INCH COMMAND SCREEN
 In comparison to the X6’s other interior features, the 10.2-inch high-resolution display screen looks like a 72-inch flat-screen TV in a studio apartment. Not that we mind as the display provides crystal-clear navigation guidance, entertainment info and readouts.
 
 BMW ULTIMATE SERVICE
 The complex nature of today’s cars makes timely maintenance all the more important. With BMW’s Ultimate Service, factory-scheduled maintenance is covered for four years or 50,000 miles, saving you money while giving added peace of mind. The service also includes four years and unlimited miles of roadside assistance.","","Changes for BMW’s 2017 X6 SUV are minor this year. The navigation system is updated to iDrive 5.0 and the Anthracite headliner is now standard. The 3.5i’s Premium package is enhanced with wireless phone charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot.; The","The base 2017 BMW X6 is the sDrive35i, which comes with a 6-cylinder engine powering the rear wheels (RWD); the xDrive35i and xDrive 50i both have all-wheel drive (AWD) standard. Other standard features include a leather interior, moonroof, power tailgate, parking sensors, 40/20/40-split folding rear seats, 10-way-power front seats with heat, and universal garage remote. A recently upgraded Bluetooth gives drivers better control over their devices, and integrates with the standard iDrive infotainment system that includes navigation, 9-speaker AM/FM/CD player with Bluetooth streaming, USB port and hard drive for music storage. The niche X6 M model has the lineup's most powerful engine.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 BMW X6 comes nicely equipped, but upgrade packages are available for those willing to pay. We suggest the Driver Assistance package that adds a rearview camera and head-up display; the Driver Assistance Plus package also adds blind-spot monitoring, bird's-eye-view camera system, active cruise control and lane-departure warning. A Bang & Olufsen sound system is available if the standard harman/kardon system isn't spectacular enough, and there are ventilated front seats, satellite radio, heated rear seats, and a heated steering wheel. M Sport and X Line packages feature 20-inch wheels and unique interior and exterior aesthetics.","Pricing Notes 
 
The least you can pay for a 2017 BMW X6, including the $995 destination charge, is the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $62,395 for a base-level X6 sDrive35i. In other words, you're paying about $6,000 more than a base X5. Add about $2,500 for all-wheel drive. If you want the V8-powered xDrive50i you're looking at nearly $77,000. And for the ultimate in ridiculous power in your SUV, the 2017 BMW X6 M starts at around $103,000. That's Porsche Cayenne money no matter how you slice it, and the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is in the same neighborhood. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their X6. If past performance is any indicator, the X6's resale value is expected to be in line with Infiniti's coupe-like SUV rival and lower than that of the Porsche.

If you need minivan-like room and versatility but won’t be caught dead driving a minivan, you’ll like the new Ford Flex. Its boxy styling maximizes interior space, while its car-like ride and numerous options, including all-wheel drive and a 365-horsepower turbocharged engine, make it the perfect all-weather family truckster.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If off-roading is your thing and you need significant ground clearance, an advanced AWD system or the ability to tow more than 4,500 pounds, scratch the Flex off your list. The Ford Explorer, or a full-framed SUV like the Ford Expedition or Chevrolet Tahoe, might be more to your liking.","The 2017 Ford Flex is part station wagon, part SUV and part minivan. It’s a unique 7-passenger crossover SUV that offers all the space and versatility large families need along with available sure-footed all-wheel drive and decent fuel economy. But it’s the Flex’s distinctive long-and-low styling that really sets it apart from its competitors including the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Chevrolet Traverse and Ford Explorer. Unlike some SUVs, the new Flex is low to the ground and makes no pretense of being off-road capable. That lower ride height makes for a smooth ride, easy step-in and cargo loading. The Flex is offered in three trim levels, SE, SEL and Limited, and there’s a choice of two V6 engines along with numerous electronic and convenience features.","Its size might suggest a truck-like driving experience, but the 2017 Ford Flex is actually quite maneuverable and car-like in the city.

ECOBOOST V6 ENGINE
 Although the Flex’s standard 287-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 is strong enough for most, check out the optional 365-horsepower twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6, which is only available on the top Limited trim level and only with all-wheel drive. Zero to 60 takes just about 6.2 seconds, which is sports-sedan territory.
 
 SYNC 3
 Ford consistently improves its Sync infotainment system, and the 2017 Flex is equipped with the latest and greatest version that is also now one of the easiest to use. The new system’s screen allows for phone-style navigation gestures like pinch and swipe, plus there’s faster performance and improved voice recognition.","","For 2017, the Ford Flex no longer offers optional heated, 2nd-row captain’s chairs with a refrigerator in the center console. The unique but unpopular option has been discontinued. Otherwise the Flex is essentially unchanged from last year’s model.; In a world of automotive sameness, the 2017 Ford Flex brings a style all its own.

All come standard with a stout 287-horsepower V6, a 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes keyless entry, a 6-way-power driver’s seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, Reverse Sensing System, front and rear air conditioning, rearview camera, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The Limited trim adds heated front seats, a 10-way-power driver’s seat, Sony Premium audio, Ford Sync 3, a heated steering wheel, navigation, leather upholstery, a power-folding 3rd-row seat and 19-inch alloy wheels. Safety equipment includes 3-row side-curtain airbags and inflatable 2nd-row safety belts.","Optional Equipment 
Options for the 2017 Ford Flex vary by trim and include the 365-horsepower EcoBoost V6 (Limited only), all-wheel drive (SEL and Limited), a power rear liftgate, heated 2nd-row seats with power Autofold mode, a 4-panel Vista roof, a contrasting-color painted roof panel, adaptive cruise control with Collision Warning and Brake Support, remote start, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Also optional is Ford’s active Park Assist, which gives the Flex the capability to parallel-park itself. The system steers the Flex into place with the driver controlling the gearshift, gas and brake pedals.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2017 front-wheel-drive Ford Flex SE starts just under $31,000. For the mid-level SEL, prices start around $33,500 (FWD) and $35,550 (AWD). A top-of-the-line Limited begins just over $39,000 with the base engine and FWD and bumps up against $44,000 with the EcoBoost V6 and AWD. Heavily optioned, a Flex Limited can easily exceed $50,000. That pricing is in line with such competitors as the Chevrolet Traverse, Mazda CX-9, Dodge Durango and Honda Pilot, but more expensive than the Kia Sorento. To make your best deal, be sure to check our Fair Purchase Price and see what typical Flex transaction prices are in your area. Considering resale value, Kelley Blue Book expects the Flex to hold a good portion of its original purchase price, on par with the Chevy Traverse, but falling slightly behind the Honda Pilot.

In addition to its well-regarded driving dynamics, handsome design and surprising efficiency, the 3 Series boasts the intangible but nevertheless enviable image of success for whoever is driving it. On the practical side, the wagon and Gran Turismo variants grant crossover-SUV-like cargo room and the nimble manners of a sedan.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The BMW 3 Series is no longer the de facto choice for up-and-comers. The latest Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the next-gen Audi A4 pack more technology and amenities. The 3 Series' price tag has the tendency to soar, and driving purists bemoan this generations' softening dynamics compared to past models.","Think of an entry-level luxury sedan and the BMW 3 Series will probably come to mind. With over 40 years of history, this compact sports sedan has cemented itself in the psyche of aspirational buyers. In that time it has grown in power, stature and efficiency, and now boasts a vast lineup. From an all-wheel-drive sedan to a sports wagon, Gran Turismo hatchback, plug-in hybrid and the tarmac-eating M3, there's a 3 Series for every buyer. The 2016 3 Series remains a sporty, versatile and efficient luxury car with instant badge appeal, but sophisticated rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and Audi A4 are right on the BMW's tail or – depending on your preferences – ahead of its twin-kidney grille.","All 2016 BMW 3 Series put a focus on driving pleasure, a trait that puts them at or near the top of the segment in terms of ride and handling....","Favorite Features 
 
WAGON, HATCH VARIANTS 
Most buyers associate the BMW 3 Series with a sedan, coupe or convertible (the latter pair now the 4 Series), but BMW's compact car is also available as a Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo, a taller riding hatchback with a cool name. Both offer extra room but retain lively driving manners. 
 
TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER 
BMW's force-fed 2.0-liter is one of the best 4-cylinders available. It's powerful, with 240 horsepower on tap for 0-60-mph blasts under six seconds, and efficient with a fuel-economy rating that reaches 35 mpg on the highway. It's the best of both worlds.","","The 2016 BMW 3 Series lineup expands again with the 330e, the first plug-in hybrid 3 Series. It effectively replaces the ActiveHybrid. Also new is the 340i, with a fresh 6-cylinder engine. The rest of the lineup receives redesigned electric power steering and chassis enhancements that include new front struts.; The 2016 BMW 3 Series' link to its past is easily seen when you line up the generations side-by-side. Even casual observers know they're looking at a BMW, and today's slightly longer and taller 3 Series differentiates itself by adding more defined character lines and creases, along with a visual connection between the headlights and the signature twin-kidney grille. The more rotund Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the aggressively styled M3 hints at the potent powertrain below its skin. All in all, the latest 3 Series retains a handsome skin that mercifully shies away from the trend of gaping grilles.","At its most basic, 320i models come with BMW's faux leather upholstery (SensaTec), manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, USB port, Bluetooth music streaming and HD Radio. Safety features standard on every 2016 BMW 3 Series include eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision. New BMWs also include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost scheduled maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.","Optional Equipment 
Options for the 2016 3 Series are both extensive and pricey. However, some features are worth their weight in gold, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation with programmable waypoints, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the available M Sport Package help bridge the performance gap between the standard 3 Series and the fire-breathing M3. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on many models in lieu of rear-wheel drive (RWD), and is standard in the wagon and Gran Turismo.","Pricing Notes 
 
The least expensive 3 Series is the 320i, with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $34,000. The more powerful 328i begins just over $39,000. From there prices only rise, with the 330e hybrid starting at about $44,700 and the 6-cylinder 340i variants beginning just under $47,000. The BMW M3 performance model begins over $64,000. Wagon and the Gran Turismo hatchbacks start in the low- to mid-$40,000 range. At these levels the majority of 3 Series are in line with small luxury-sedan rivals like the Lexus IS, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q50 and the all-new Jaguar XE. For comparison values, check out the Acura TLX, while the Volvo S60 comes with impressive safety features for less money. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are paying for their 3 Series.

It’s true a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS offers a more engaging drive, but not every luxury-car buyer is a driving enthusiast shopping for an all-out sports sedan. The new Lexus ES proves there’s still a place for a premium automobile with strong performance balanced with traditional values of comfort and dependability.","If a serene ride and a quiet cabin are your idea of luxury, you’ll find the new 2017 Lexus ES 350 luxury sedan and 300h hybrid-luxury sedan extremely satisfying.

HYBRID POWERTRAIN
 Where some hybrid EPA estimates seem like laboratory-only probabilities, the 2017 Lexus ES 300h is the real deal. Without even trying, the 40-mpg combined average was a regular occurrence in our tests. In addition, the combined 200 horsepower is sufficient, and the powertrain is extremely smooth.
 
 CREATURE COMFORTS
 Lexus never shorts customers on luxury items. Our new ES featured a heated steering wheel, panoramic sunroof and an 835-watt, 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system that left our jaws agape and our ears ringing. Seat comfort is also high thanks to 10-way-power adjustments, high-quality leather and supportive shaping.","","The 2017 Lexus ES 350 and ES 300h; Once the very definition of a conservative sedan, the current-generation Lexus ES has taken on a bold new look with sleek lines and the aggressive Lexus ""spindle"" grille. With the revised front end introduced last year, the 2017 Lexus ES and ES hybrid fall right in line with the sporty","Every new ES comes with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror and a HomeLink garage-door opener. Newly standard this year is the Lexus Safety System+ package, introduced last year as an option. The system includes Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam (IHB) and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. Bluetooth, heated outside mirrors, 10-way-power adjustable front seats and a rearview camera are also standard as are the sedan’s 10 airbags, and Lexus' Automatic Collision Notification, which notifies emergency assistance in the event of an accident.","Optional Equipment 
Among features available on the lengthy options list for Lexus’ 2017 ES 350 and hybrid ES 300h are a navigation system, leather and aniline-leather seats that can be heated and ventilated, a panorama glass roof, power rear sunshade, and an awesome Mark Levinson premium sound system. It also offers radar cruise control, a lane-departure warning system, parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Fully loaded examples will also feature a heated wood-and-leather steering wheel, a one-touch power trunklid, a power tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, memory seats, door sunshades and perhaps the ultimate luxury, a genuine wood-trimmed cup holder.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2017 Lexus ES 350 is right around $40,000, including the $940 destination charge. If you want hybrid power, the ES 300h starts just under $43,000. Add options, and you can inflate the price of either car to just over the $50,000 mark, a relative bargain for a luxury brand. That's higher than cars like the Hyundai Genesis and the surprisingly good Buick LaCrosse, but notably less than cars like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Cadillac CTS. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers are actually paying for the 2017 Lexus ES in your area. Down the road, sleep well knowing that a strong resale value is one of the strongest selling points for the Lexus ES.

The 2017 Ford Fusion answers a lot of transportation questions. If you want a practical and affordable family sedan, it has you covered. It's also an eco-friendly hybrid or plug-in hybrid. The new Platinum and Sport models promise luxury and performance, respectively, and the Fusion remains a high-tech champ.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
There's not a lot working against the Fusion. Diesel fans will have to look elsewhere, although the Hybrid models do extremely well on fuel economy. About the only other thing we can imagine is brand loyalty.","For 2017 the new Ford Fusion gets a thorough refresh in the name of keeping it competitive with the class-leading Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Kia Optima. There are also two new models. First is a luxury edition called Fusion Platinum that adds leather on the dash, piped seating and other tech and luxury upgrades. The other is the new Fusion Sport, which adds all-wheel drive (AWD) and a 2.7-liter 325-horsepower V6 engine, blending family-car and sports-sedan sensibilities into one car. The rest of the lineup sticks with 4-cylinder engines, while the two hybrid models -- the Fusion Hybrid and plug-in Fusion Hybrid Energi -- return to anchor the eco-friendly end of the lineup.","The 2017 Ford Fusion wants to be all things to all people, and it does a surprisingly good job of it, in both front- and all-wheel-drive forms (FWD, AWD).

PLUG-IN HYBRID VERSION
 With electrification a bigger deal these days, the Fusion Hybrid Energi with its 21 miles of electric-only driving range is a serious player that could let its driver go literally weeks without refueling. But you can still take that road trip thanks to the gasoline engine, and a subsequent 610-mile range.
 
 V6 POWER
 Fine, we're suckers for horsepower, and the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport has it in spades with its 2.7-liter 325-horsepower twin-turbo V6. Coupled with AWD and an even better suspension, the Fusion Sport promises to be an Audi A6 for those on a budget.","","Ford’s new Fusion gets subtly revised exterior styling, mainly focusing on the nose, headlights, lower bumper and rear taillights. There are also changes inside, with a new rotary shifter and upgraded Sync infotainment system. Two new models also debut: the luxury-oriented Platinum, and the sporty, V6-powered Fusion Sport.; The grille, headlights, lower bumper and taillights on the 2017 Fusion have been reworked subtly, but effectively.

On top of that, the Fusion S comes with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, and Ford's Sync wireless communication system with voice control. Fusion SE models add a 10-way-power driver's seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. Higher-end models get the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, upgraded audio systems, Sync3 with greatly improved usability, and niceties like dual-zone auto climate control, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.","Optional Equipment 
Besides the two new models -- the performance-oriented Fusion Sport and the near-luxury Fusion Platinum -- there are plenty of stand-alone options. You can add blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness, and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There's a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. All-wheel drive is also available on SE, Titanium, Sport and Platinum models, making it one of the few family sedans ready for foul-weather security in Snowbelt states.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Ford Fusion S with its standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $23,000, including the $875 destination charge. However, the SE offers more for your money at about the $25,000 mark when equipped with the 1.5-liter 4-cylinder. Titanium models start at about $31,000; the new V6 Fusion Sport at about $34,300, and the Fusion Platinum at about $37,500. AWD adds about $2,000. A base Hybrid S starts at about $26,000, with prices spanning all the way up to the $42,000 Hybrid Energi Platinum.

If you crave the cargo-carrying versatility of a crossover SUV but the handling of a European sports sedan, the 2017 Volvo V60 was born to fit the bill. It also doesn't hurt that it's wrapped in a beautiful suit, has power to spare and a sterling reputation for safety.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you need even more space or want a more traditional SUV, look to one of the many luxury-crossover SUVs like the V60's own sibling the XC60 or fresh XC90. Speaking of fresh, the V60 has an elegant and enticing new big brother in the V90 and V90 Cross Country.","If you need proof that a station wagon can be sexy, the Volvo V60 is Exhibit A. This is Swedish elegance and execution at its best, with a slightly sloped roof that suggests a shooting-brake design, yet all the carrying capability, innovative safety features and premium appeal expected from a Volvo. If you need proof that a European station wagon can be Americanized, look no further than the V60 Cross Country, a higher-riding, more rugged all-wheel-drive variant. And if you want to haul more than just gear, 300-plus-horsepower variants are ready and willing. Whichever you go with, you'll get a satisfying luxury wagon that makes a tempting alternative to the Audi Allroad and BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo.","Part of the 2017 Volvo V60 wagon's allure is that it feels at home on a variety of roads and in various settings, from long highway stretches to mountain roads....","Favorite Features 
 
DRIVE-E
 While its name may be confusing -- and has nothing to do with electric propulsion -- the Drive-E engine family offers up surprisingly impressive fuel economy and even more impressive performance. It’s one of the smoothest, most refined 4-cylinder turbos on the market.
 
 CROSS COUNTRY
 The Cross Country adds an additional 2.6 inches of ground clearance and standard Haldex all-wheel drive (AWD), allowing the V60 to venture lightly off-road as well as tackle deeper snow drifts.","","The 2017 Volvo V60 lineup bids adieu to its 5- and 6-cylinder engines. All models are now powered by various iterations of Volvo's magnificent force-fed 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. Other changes involve small revisions to trim packages and features.; This may be the best-looking of Volvo's ""60"" series of cars, which includes the S60 sedan and XC60 SUV. The V60's profile is graceful and elegant, with a sloping roofline that extends the cargo area, but without making it look like a sedan wearing a backpack. In fact, some of us prefer it over the stubby-trunk look of the S60, and still others like its sleek, low-to-the-ground stance compared to the XC60. The Volvo V60 Cross Country sits a bit higher than the standard model, but the result is rugged, not awkward.","The standard 2017 Volvo V60 is available across a half-dozen trims, while the V60 Cross Country is offered in two. Even a base model is nicely equipped with 8-way-power front seats, moonroof, heated exterior mirrors and dual-zone climate control. The infotainment system is aging but has a 7-inch command screen with HD Radio tuner, Bluetooth connectivity, USB/auxiliary inputs and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Volvo furthers its safety reputation by making its City Safety low-speed automatic-braking system standard. The 2017 V60 also comes with three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance. V60 Cross Country models have all-wheel drive, navigation, 18-inch wheels and skidplates.","Optional Equipment 
Climb trims and you'll get a better and better equipped European wagon. Additional amenities include full leather interior, harman/kardon premium audio system, heated front and rear seats, and universal garage remote. Among the optional safety and driving aids are adaptive cruise control, collision-warning system with full auto brake and pedestrian/cyclist detection, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and parking sensors. A sport chassis and integrated roof rails are also offered. All-wheel drive (AWD) can be had in lieu of front-drive (FWD) for lower models and is standard on the V60 Cross Country.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volvo V60 wagon has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $37,000 in front-drive form. As you climb trims, that price increases, with R-Design models just under $50,000 before options. If you're willing to spend the $60,000-plus it takes to buy a V60 Polestar, know that they're in short supply: Only about 200 Polestars have been allocated to the U.S. market, and that includes S60 Polestar sedans. The V60 Cross Country starts closer to $43,000. At its base price, the Volvo V60, even in all-wheel-drive form, undercuts the Audi A4 Allroad and BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo by several thousand dollars, while the more similar V60 Cross Country is in line with those competitors. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new V60. Resale value is expected to trail that of the Audi Allroad.

If you're looking for a comfortable, refined, high-tech and affordable midsize 4-door, then the Hyundai Sonata should hit your sweet spot. Whether you want a low base price, fuel-sipping hybrid technology, or just a comfortable sedan that flirts with luxury levels of equipment, the Sonata has you covered.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
Some might say that ""conservatively handsome"" is just another way of saying ""bland,"" and there's no doubt that the Sonata's styling isn't exactly dynamic. There are more fuel-efficient hybrids available, and it's hard to argue against the decades of momentum behind the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.","The midsize-sedan market is possibly the most competitive in the U.S. Not only do you have the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, pretty much everything else is at least a solid player, like the Ford Fusion, Chevy Malibu, Nissan Altima and our Best Buy winner, the Kia Optima. So it's no small feat that the 2017 Hyundai Sonata stands out from this distinguished crowd. Credit the choice of naturally aspirated, turbocharged, hybrid and plug-in drivetrains; conservatively handsome styling, the latest in high-tech, and a comfortable and quiet driving environment. This year, Apple CarPlay is part of the technology, and the base Sonata even gets a $150 price reduction, making it the least expensive car in its class.","A 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 185 horsepower anchors the Sonata lineup as standard equipment. Paired with the 6-speed automatic transmission, it offers satisfying acceleration and decent fuel economy. But for those...","Favorite Features 
 
VARIETY
 If variety is the spice of life, then the 2017 Hyundai Sonata lineup is an Indian buffet at lunchtime. Whether you want a budget-conscious 4-door, sporty-feeling family car, or a fuel-averse commuter, the Hyundai Sonata has you covered with its plethora of different models.
 
 APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO
 Even though both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are rapidly becoming the rule and not the exception, they're still both among our favorite features wherever they appear. The technology fully integrates your Android or iPhone into your car's infotainment system, giving you the same functionality that you're used to.","","Two noteworthy changes for the 2017 Sonata include adaptive headlights on Limited models, and Apple CarPlay that was added during the 2016 cycle.; Like the interior, about the worst thing you can say about the 2017 Sonata exterior is that it's a little bland. However, more ""conservatively handsome"" designs like the current Sonata tend to look fresh longer than more outré styling, such as on the previous Sonata. Still, it's not totally generic. We like the chrome line extending from the headlights down the flanks of the car, and Hybrid and Eco models benefit from unique trim designed to enhance aerodynamics and improve fuel economy.","Even the base-model Sonata SE comes nicely equipped. There are automatic headlights, an infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen that includes USB and Bluetooth smartphone integration, plus a rearview camera. These add to features such as air conditioning, power windows with pinch protection, power locks, a driver’s blind-spot mirror, stability and traction control, and cloth seats. Other standard features include a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seatback. Safety equipment comprises seven airbags, including a driver's knee airbag, plus standard stability control and electronic brake assist.","Optional Equipment 
The best way to add features to a 2017 Sonata is to climb the model ladder, from SE to Sport to Limited. Sport adds a power driver's seat, plus an available sunroof and more. It also opens you up to the turbocharged engine, as does the Limited. Other available features include a 10-speaker Infinity sound system, smart cruise control with stop/start capability, automatic high beams, ventilated front seats and a panoramic tilt/slide sunroof. A particularly useful option is the hands-free trunk release; if you have the key with you and stand near the trunk, it automatically opens after a few seconds.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata is about $22,800, including the $835 destination charge. The Eco is next on the ladder, starting just under $24,000, while the Sonata Sport is just over that figure. The Limited starts at the $28,000 mark. If you want a turbo you'll add $3,200 to the Sport, or more than $6,000 to the Limited, although the turbo adds a lot of standard equipment on the latter. Final hybrid prices haven't been finalized, but they'll likely stay close to last year's numbers, a little below $27,000 for the regular hybrid, and about $35,500 for the plug-in hybrid. Those prices are in line with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, with a slight price advantage overall. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area, and note that the Sonata's projected mid-pack resale value has been improving.

They may not be as exciting visually or drive-wise, but they are better suited for shuttling more adults over longer distances.","The 2017 Maxima is Nissan's flagship sedan, just one year into an all-new generation that brought drastically different styling inside and out. Nissan calls the Maxima a ""4-Door Sports Car,"" but we think of it as an even more interesting proposition. Yes, with its standard 300-horsepower V6 and taut chassis, the Maxima is quick and nimble. But its long list of standard features and premium amenities makes this Nissan feel more like an upscale vehicle. As a whole, the 2017 Nissan Maxima boasts enjoyable road manners, head-turning looks and high value. But it's conflicted in interior space, with less rear-seat legroom than the Chevrolet Impala, Toyota Avalon and its own sibling the Nissan Altima. Its front-drive layout, meanwhile, won't appeal to sports-sedan purists.","Even though Nissan bills the Maxima as a ""4-Door Sports Car,"" this is no budget-conscious BMW M3. Rather, it's a sporty entry-level luxury sedan, and...","Favorite Features 
 
PREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING (PFCW)
 Forward-collision warning systems that alert drivers about stopped or slowed vehicles are becoming commonplace. The Nissan Maxima sports sedan's Predictive Forward Collision Warning goes one better by monitoring two cars ahead. Nissan says this lets its PFCW react earlier to an emergency.
 
 NISSANCONNECT
 The Maxima Platinum model includes NissanConnect Services, Nissan's telematics services. Its wide range of functions goes beyond the standard NissanConnect features to include automatic collision notification, remote starting via smartphone and a stolen-vehicle locator. New this year, the system is enhanced with Apple CarPlay, a welcome addition for those with iPhones.","Despite its flagship status, the 5-passenger Nissan Maxima is actually a little smaller inside than the Nissan Altima sedan, which is slightly shorter. However, the Altima can't compare to the Maxima's upscale atmosphere. The diamond pattern on the accent trim extends to the seats and door panels on upper-level models. The stitched and soft-touch dash and doors impart a premium feel, as does the 8-inch infotainment system with its console-mounted multifunction knob. The driver and front passenger easily get comfortable thanks to power seats and tilt-telescope steering, but the rear seat's lack of head- and legroom may leave tall passengers complaining.","Nissan has packed a lot of styling onto the Maxima sedan. Nissan's V-Motion grille treatment dominates the front end, and like it or not, you sure know what's coming your way. Similarly, there's a lot of styling on the sides. The Maxima's roof, for example, appears to float over the rest of the body thanks to some clever paintwork. The sides are sculpted with intersecting character lines, and even the rear of the car, normally a weak point in styling, gets highlighted with sculpted taillights, twin chrome exhausts and a chrome lip over the license plate.","All 2017 Maximas are the same under the hood, sporting a 3.5-liter V6 engine with 300 horsepower and a CVT automatic transmission. Also standard are LED headlight and taillight accents. Even base-model Maxima S sedans come with NissanConnect, an 8-inch touch-screen navigation and infotainment system with voice command, Google search, Bluetooth, two USB ports and Apple CarPlay integration for 2017. Also standard are an 8-way-power driver's seat, cruise control, push-button ignition and keyless entry, and a rearview camera. The color 7-inch information screen between the main gauges is standard on all models. Safety equipment includes six airbags, plus stability and traction control.","Optional Equipment 
Nissan adds features through the 2017 Maxima's four higher trim levels instead of options packages. With its leather upholstery, heated front seats and heated outside mirrors with LED turn signals, and front and rear parking sensors, even a Maxima SV is a highly recommendable vehicle. SL and Platinum models get a dual-panel panoramic moonroof, upgraded audio systems, blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, forward emergency braking, and the predictive forward-collision warning. The sporty SR loses the panoramic roof but gains bigger wheels/tires, while the luxury-like Platinum also gets moving-object detection, a driver-attention alert system and surround-view camera.","Under the Hood 
 
There's only one engine choice available for the Nissan Maxima, but it's a good one: a 300-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 connected to an Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). It manages decent fuel economy, all while delivering smooth and quiet power to the front wheels. CVTs have come a long way, and Nissan's D-Step shift logic mimics the operation of a traditional automatic by letting the revs rise and fall when at full throttle. A Sport mode livens feel by adjusting throttle response, steering effort and transmission tuning. Given its 300 horsepower, we're impressed that the Maxima doesn't suffer from undue torque steer, a peculiar side-to-side wiggle felt in the steering wheel that's common in powerful front-wheel-drive cars. Note that premium unleaded is recommended for the Maxima.
 
 3.5-liter V6
 300 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm
 261 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Nissan Maxima sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $33,395 for a base S model. If you want leather seating and a more supportive driver's seat, spend the roughly $2,000 more for a Maxima SV. The rest of the lineup climbs into the high $30,000s, and the top-line Maxima Platinum starts over $40,000. At these prices the Maxima starts higher than a Chevrolet Impala and Acura TLX, but the Nissan boasts more standard grunt. It nearly mimics the starting prices of the Toyota Avalon, Kia Cadenza and Hyundai Azera, which also offer a V6 as standard. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Maxima. The Nissan Maxima's resale value is expected to fare pretty well, in line with that of the Avalon and above that of the Impala, Cadenza and Azera.

The system includes automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, pre-collision and braking with pedestrian detection plus lane-departure alert and steering assist.; The Avalon’s masculine stance and sculpted bodywork were conceived by Toyota’s Southern California-based Calty Design studio.

 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
 All-wheel drive isn’t just about conquering snow-covered roads; it offers improved handling and cornering in all weather conditions. On the Regal, Buick’s AWD setup not only routes power from front to back, it can also distribute it from side-to-side when needed.","","For 2017, Buick’s Regal sedan gains Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility plus three new metallic paint colors: Graphite Gray, Black Cherry and Pepperdust.; Buick’s Regal for 2017 remains a classy-looking sedan, thanks in no small part to its European roots, where the same car is called an Opel Insignia.

Other options include a power sunroof, 18- and 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels (20-inchers on the GS) and a 120-volt outlet.

The Sport Touring bumps the price up to $29,500, while the Premium II starts at $32,500. The Regal GS starts at a little over $35,000 and all-wheel drive adds roughly $2,000 to the bottom line. We think the Premium II offers the best balance between features and price for most buyers, costing thousands less than the Audi A4, on par with the Acura TLX but still more than the Ford Fusion Titanium.

If you like getting noticed for what you drive and you live near one of the 2017 Mirai’s designated hydrogen-fuel stations, this car will generate more buzz than a new Lamborghini. Toyota picks up the hydrogen tab for the first three years; after that, you’re on your own.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
More novelty than daily driver, the 2017 Toyota Mirai can’t take you on long trips, nor is it particularly fun to drive. You can spend a lot less and get a plug-in hybrid that is more efficient and practical.","If only hydrogen filling stations were as plentiful as their gasoline counterparts, then everyone could know the joy of driving Toyota’s 4-passenger 2017 Mirai fuel-cell vehicle (FCV). The Mirai is actually an electric car powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which operates by converting hydrogen and oxygen into electricity with its only emission being water vapor. Toyota claims the 2017 Mirai can travel up to 300 miles before refueling, making it about as mainstream as a 21st-century electric car can be. Others have been here before, namely Honda’s FCX Clarity and Hyundai’s Tucson FCV, but Toyota is the first to really push the idea of putting a Mirai in every driveway, providing that driveway is within 300 miles of a hydrogen fueling station.","If you didn’t know hydrogen and oxygen were combining under the hood to power the 2017 Toyota Mirai’s electric motor, you might easily think you were driving just another electric...","Favorite Features 
 
MOBILE GENERATOR
 While you may be able to jump-start your friend’s car with your primitive fossil-fuel-powered vehicle, the 2017 Toyota Mirai can power your entire house for up to one week. Using the optional PTO (Power Take-Off) device, the Mirai can become an electric power generator perfect for emergency situations.
 
 24/7 CARE
 Toyota knows how to calm worries around pushing a new technology, so they offer a fuel-cell-savvy concierge service, a longer-range loner vehicle for up to seven days a year, enhanced roadside assistance, an app for locating hydrogen-fuel stations and three years free fuel.","","The 2017 Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle gains a new color: Atmospheric Blue.; While Toyota’s 2017 Mirai FCV's styling is intentionally futuristic, there are specific elements that are there out of necessity. Two large intakes in front pull in air to get heat out of the Mirai's three radiators. The airflow is also key to the Mirai's aerodynamics. While Toyota explained that the design theme of the Mirai is that of flowing water, with a rear end resembling a catamaran, most people will most likely be too amazed by the Mirai's looks to notice the water theme.","The Mirai fuel-cell vehicle for 2017 comes with numerous features as standard, many of which are aimed at making hydrogen life easier. Hydrogen fill-ups are free for three years. There is 24/7 concierge service as well as 24/7 roadside assistance. Toyota Care maintenance is free for three years. Entune comes standard, along with three years of Safety Connect (including the hydrogen station map app).","Optional Equipment 
With a vehicle this specialized and with a premium price, it should come as no surprise that there are relatively few options. In fact, there's only one: The Power Take-Off unit could be a lifesaver in case of emergency. It turns the Mirai into a generator that can power a typical-size house's basic electrical needs for up to a week.","Pricing Notes 
 
As is the case with many fuel-cell vehicles, there is an option to lease. In the case of the 2017 Toyota Mirai, $2,499 will be due at signing, and the lease is $349 a month for 36 months with a 12,000-mile-per-year allowance. Unlike other FCVs, however, you can buy the new Mirai. While buying one would cost $58,365, there are incentives of up to $13,000, bringing the price closer to $45,000. As the Mirai is such a unique vehicle, resale information is still unavailable, but given Toyota’s reputation, we suspect as other FCV’s come to market, the Mirai will hold its value better than most.

The 2017 Ford Fusion answers a lot of transportation questions. If you want a practical and affordable family sedan, it has you covered. It's also an eco-friendly hybrid or plug-in hybrid. The new Platinum and Sport models promise luxury and performance, respectively, and the Fusion remains a high-tech champ.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
There's not a lot working against the Fusion. Diesel fans will have to look elsewhere, although the Hybrid models do extremely well on fuel economy. About the only other thing we can imagine is brand loyalty.","For 2017 the new Ford Fusion gets a thorough refresh in the name of keeping it competitive with the class-leading Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Kia Optima. There are also two new models. First is a luxury edition called Fusion Platinum that adds leather on the dash, piped seating and other tech and luxury upgrades. The other is the new Fusion Sport, which adds all-wheel drive (AWD) and a 2.7-liter 325-horsepower V6 engine, blending family-car and sports-sedan sensibilities into one car. The rest of the lineup sticks with 4-cylinder engines, while the two hybrid models -- the Fusion Hybrid and plug-in Fusion Hybrid Energi -- return to anchor the eco-friendly end of the lineup.","The 2017 Ford Fusion wants to be all things to all people, and it does a surprisingly good job of it, in both front- and all-wheel-drive forms (FWD, AWD).

PLUG-IN HYBRID VERSION
 With electrification a bigger deal these days, the Fusion Hybrid Energi with its 21 miles of electric-only driving range is a serious player that could let its driver go literally weeks without refueling. But you can still take that road trip thanks to the gasoline engine, and a subsequent 610-mile range.
 
 V6 POWER
 Fine, we're suckers for horsepower, and the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport has it in spades with its 2.7-liter 325-horsepower twin-turbo V6. Coupled with AWD and an even better suspension, the Fusion Sport promises to be an Audi A6 for those on a budget.","The new 2017 Fusion Platinum interior, with its stitched dash and premium leather seats with contrast piping, is sumptuous enough to make the Lincoln MKZ feel redundant. Other upgrades this year for the rest of the lineup include a rotary shifter and electronic parking brake. However, Ford has largely kept the roomy 5-passenger interior intact. It's roomy enough for four adults, three kids can fit in back, and its big trunk holds more than a Honda Accord’s. Hybrid models have a smaller trunk owing to the battery, but even they have a pass-through to the rear seats for longer items.","The grille, headlights, lower bumper and taillights on the 2017 Fusion have been reworked subtly, but effectively. It still looks like an","The base-model 2017 Fusion S comes nicely equipped, starting with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission. On top of that, the Fusion S comes with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, and Ford's Sync wireless communication system with voice control. Fusion SE models add a 10-way-power driver's seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. Higher-end models get the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, upgraded audio systems, Sync3 with greatly improved usability, and niceties like dual-zone auto climate control, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.","Optional Equipment 
Besides the two new models -- the performance-oriented Fusion Sport and the near-luxury Fusion Platinum -- there are plenty of stand-alone options. You can add blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness, and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There's a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. All-wheel drive is also available on SE, Titanium, Sport and Platinum models, making it one of the few family sedans ready for foul-weather security in Snowbelt states.","Under the Hood 
 
There are six different ways to motivate your 2017 Fusion. The base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder exists, and you should skip it. Instead, start at the SE sedan, which comes standard with the 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with the option of upgrading to the 2.0-liter version. The 2.0-liter is standard in the Titanium and Platinum models. Fusion Sport comes with a new-for-Fusion 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 with 325 horsepower, making it the most powerful car in its class. The two electrically augmented Fusion models -- Fusion Hybrid and Hybrid Energi plug-in -- use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission for excellent fuel economy; the Energi has up to 21 miles of EV range. AWD is available with the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder.

If you want a sporty, European-derived compact sedan at a non-European price, the 2017 VW Jetta delivers the contemporary design and handling dynamics for which German cars are known. The Jetta is also fuel-efficient, earning up to 40 mpg with a manual transmission.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want a small diesel car, you'll have to look to Chevrolet, which plans one for the 2017 Cruze. If you want fun-to-drive alternatives, the Mazda3 makes a strong case, as does the Honda Civic. Need an all-wheel-drive compact car? See the Subaru Impreza or the VW Golf SportWagen.","Like other vehicles in Volkswagen's 2017 lineup, the Jetta compact sedan returns with something of a limp. That's because, as with other models, the once-desirable diesel models are not being offered in the wake of the German automaker's emissions-cheating scandal. VW optimistically says the Jetta's trim lineup has been ""simplified,"" with the former hybrid model also being shown the door. Still, what remains has some appeal. All 2017 Jettas are powered by turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engines, ranging from a small 1.4-liter in lower models to the potent 210-horsepower 2.0-liter in the performance-oriented Jetta GLI. The Jetta stands out from rivals like the venerable Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic with European character and spry manners, but its uphill battle against those stalwarts just got steeper.","All Jettas remain on the spry, fun-to-drive spectrum among compact sedans, and that attribute only intensifies as you climb trims. The Jetta S and SE models come with...","Favorite Features 
 
GLI
 For drivers seeking a cure for the boring sedan, the Jetta GLI is welcome medicine. In addition to sporty manners, the GLI brings the most standard equipment in the Jetta's lineup, including advanced safety and driving aids, and a premium audio system.
 
 1.4T TURBOCHARGED GASOLINE ENGINE
 This powerplant recently replaced the dated, 115-horsepower 2.0-liter engine formerly used in Jetta base models, and the car is far better for it. This thoroughly modern engine grants a great balance of power and efficiency.","","For 2017, the Jetta lineup loses its diesel and hybrid offerings, and has been trimmed to four trims. Even base models now get a rearview camera standard, and the blind-spot monitoring safety system is standard starting on Jetta SE models.; As with its sleek yet minimalistic interior, the 2017 Jetta's exterior styling favors quiet sophistication over swooping lines, a massive grille or -- heaven forbid -- a giant rear spoiler. This is European subtlety, clean and simple. We're rather fond of this approach, and while the Jetta may not scream, ""Look at me,"" we wager it will stand the test of time better than a fair share of its rivals. Jetta GLI models can be spotted via their unique front fascia with a red line running across the grille, red brake calipers and a small rear spoiler built into the trunk.","The 2017 Jetta lineup has been reduced to four trims: S, SE, SEL and the top-line, performance-oriented GLI. At its most basic, the Jetta includes a turbocharged engine, 5-speed manual transmission (automatic is optional), rearview camera, 6-way driver's seat with height adjustment, and 16-inch wheels. Infotainment is provided by a 5-inch color touch-screen system that incorporates AM/FM/CD player with SD and USB ports, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. For $3,000 more, the SE model includes power sunroof, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, larger touch-screen display with phone app features, faux leather seating, push-button start and premium wheels.","Optional Equipment 
Aside from a 6-speed automatic transmission that's standard on SEL models, most extras in the 2017 Jetta sedan are had by climbing trims. The SEL also includes a more powerful engine, power driver's seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation system, rain-sensing windshield wipers and forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Top-line GLI models add a still-more-powerful engine, sport-tuned suspension, 400-watt Fender premium audio system and the Park Pilot front and rear parking-sensor system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Volkswagen Jetta has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $18,715 for a base, manual-transmission model. Most buyers will opt for an automatic, which is an extra $1,100. We recommend at least stepping up to the $21,715 SE model, which has more amenities and the blind-spot monitoring safety feature. The Jetta SEL begins quite a bit higher at $25,815, while the 2017 Jetta GLI starts at $28,715 and can reach to just under $30,000 with an automatic transmission. At these prices, the Jetta begins slightly above rivals like the Honda Civic, Chevrolet Cruze, Toyota Corolla, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Jetta. Going forward, we expect the Jetta's resale value to be on the lower end of the compact-car spectrum.

A variety of models and trims -- from a manual-transmission coupe or sedan to an ultra-fuel-efficient hybrid -- only sweetens the 2017 Accord's overall proposition.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want all-wheel drive for enhanced traction in inclement weather, check out the Subaru Impreza or Ford Fusion. A potentially fussy touch-screen system for audio and climate controls on higher trims is among the Accord's few downsides.","Whether you're looking for the Labrador retriever of family-friendly midsize sedans, a stylish and powerful coupe, or a refined hybrid that kisses 50 mpg, the 2017 Honda Accord delivers like few others. Long loved for its faithful reliability, great resale value and inherent ability to please a wide palette of buyers, the 2017 Accord remains a highly recommendable car even as rivals clamor for its benchmark status. The Accord just marked its 40th anniversary, and it shows no sign of resting on its laurels. The standard model was upgraded last year with features like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and automatic emergency braking, and this year marks the reintroduction of a hybrid model. We continue to like almost everything about the Accord except its optional touch-screen controls.","All Accord models are brisk, compliant and comfortable, with each particular model offering more or less of those traits depending on drivetrain. The bread-and-butter 4-cylinder Accord with an automatic transmission...","Favorite Features 
 
HONDA LANEWATCH
 This safety system has been around a few years and still impresses. Via a camera mounted under the right-side mirror, it displays a real-time view of what's happening in the next lane when you activate the turn signal, showing whatever may be in your blind spot so you don't collide.
 
 ACCORD HYBRID
 One of the best things about the reintroduced Accord Hybrid -- aside from its nearly 50-mpg rating -- is that it looks just like a regular Accord. For buyers who want great fuel economy but don't want way-out-there looks, the hybrid Accord is an excellent choice.","","The big news for the 2017 Accord is a relaunched hybrid model that's more powerful and offers the impressive HondaSensing roster of safety/driver-aid features standard. Also new to the lineup is the Sport Special Edition sedan, which includes leather interior, red stitching and other flair beyond the Sport model.; The 2017 Honda Accord pulls off quite a feat when it comes to style: It looks handsome, contemporary, yet timeless. This is a well-proportioned vehicle whose design will likely hold up well as the years pass. The Accord coupe, too, looks elegant, sporty and more expensive than it is. Among the few traits of which we're on the fence is the way the grille wraps into the elongated headlights; it can be a little too sweeping. Hybrid Accord models look similar to their gasoline-only counterparts, except for their small hybrid badges and blue accents on the grille, headlights and taillights.","Including the new Sport Special Edition, the 2017 Accord sedan is available in seven trims. At the lowest end, a base LX includes rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with Bluetooth connectivity and USB and auxiliary inputs, and an 8-inch color display. We recommend stepping up to at least the Sport or Sport Special Edition, which include 10-way-power-adjustable driver's seat, LED fog lights and daytime running lights, split-folding rear seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and in the Special Edition, leather interior with heated front seats. The Accord's standard safety features include antilock brakes and stability- and traction-control systems.","Optional Equipment 
Most extras come by climbing trims, with a notable exception being the HondaSensing suite of features that we heartily recommend. For $1,000, it includes lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation braking, and road-departure mitigation system. HondaSensing is standard on top-line Touring and all hybrid models of the 2017 Accord. Other extras available depending on trim include the LaneWatch blind-spot monitoring system, navigation, upgraded audio, HomeLink integrated garage opener, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and the HondaLink smartphone connectivity system.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Honda Accord has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $23,000 for a base, manual-transmission sedan. Most buyers will opt for an automatic transmission, an extra $800. We think you'll be even more satisfied in a Sport or Sport Special Edition model, which sits in the mid-$20,000 range, also the point at which Accord Coupe models begin. A top-line Accord Touring model sits above $35,000 in both sedan and coupe form. Finally, the new Accord Hybrid starts just over $30,000 and tops out at nearly $37,000 in Touring form. At these prices, the Hondas are in step with longtime rival the Toyota Camry, as well as the Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Accord, which is expected to hold its value well, just below the Toyota Camry and Subaru Legacy.

Kia’s Optima sedan for 2017 delivers stellar good looks, an impressive array of features, a stunning interior and a wide range of models, including a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. The competitively priced Optima also comes standard with a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re looking for safety on a budget, you should know Kia doesn’t offer its best driver-assist technology on its most affordable trims. A Toyota Camry or Honda Accord might be a better choice, or the Subaru Legacy, which also includes standard all-wheel drive.","For 2017, the Kia Optima sedan continues its march to perfection, building on the impressive improvements from last year’s launch by adding a plug-in hybrid model. Already a segment leader in the areas of performance, power, fuel economy and technology, the 2017 Optima sedan expands the availability of driver-assist features such as autonomous braking, but only on the EX and higher trims. For comparison, Toyota has this technology standard on every Camry regardless of trim. However, in almost every other area of interest to buyers, the Optima is more than a match for its rivals, including the Chevy Malibu, Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion.","While we would never confuse this midsize family sedan with a BMW, Audi or Cadillac sports sedan, the 2017 Kia Optima delivers performance and...","Favorite Features 
 
ANDROID AUTO & APPLE CARPLAY
 As hard as they try, the auto manufacturers just couldn’t build an infotainment system to rival what Apple gave us with the first iPhone. Now, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, they don’t have to. Just plug in your smartphone and a mirror image appears on the car’s touch-screen interface.
 
 HARMAN/KARDON AUDIO
 Although you can find harman/kardon systems in other cars, the QuantumLogic7 surround audio system in the 2017 Kia Optima goes one step beyond. The sound is amazing and even old MP3 files find new life thanks to the Clari-Fi feature that helps restore digitally compressed files.","","The 2017 Kia Optima gets a new plug-in hybrid model with an estimated 600-mile total driving range, but only 27 of that in full EV mode. The SX and SXL receive new 18-inch wheels, LED adaptive headlights and auto high beams; the SX gains a Value Package and revised Launch Edition package.; One school of thought on the 2017 Kia Optima's styling is that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The previous-generation Optima was still a great-looking","The base-model 2017 Kia Optima LX comes with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Beyond that, there's a Driver Mode Select system that switches among Normal, Sport and Eco modes. Other Optima LX standard features include manual air conditioning, a 5-inch LCD screen with a rearview camera, and controls on the tilt-telescope steering wheel for the cruise control and audio system, which includes Sirius satellite radio, Bluetooth and Auxiliary and USB inputs. The two front seats both adjust six different ways, with power lumbar support for the driver, and adjustable height on the passenger side.","Optional Equipment 
The 2017 Kia Optima LX 1.6T comes with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the SX and SXL get a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine and a much improved power-steering system. Kia has also made its blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors available on LX models. Optima EX and SX buyers can add active cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning, while the SXL features all these and a surround-view monitor. Other upgrades include dual-zone climate control, heated rear seats, a dual-panel panoramic sunroof with an opaque power sunshade, and the excellent harman/kardon audio system.","Pricing Notes 
 
Prices start modestly for the 2017 Kia Optima. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base Optima LX will run the same as last year, about $23,100 with the $825 destination charge. The LX 1.6T starts just over $25,000, while the EX will run about $25,300. If you want more turbo power, the SX starts around $30,800, while the fully loaded, Nappa-leather SXL tops out at $37,000. The Optima Hybrid starts just shy of $27,000, while the Optima Plug-in Hybrid starts at $36,500.

You've reached the stage in life where you demand to drive the best, but you prefer understated sophistication over flashy flamboyance. That describes the 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, at least the big sedan and 2-door coupe. As for the new Cabriolet, well, there's just no dialing back that kind of visual decadence.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
In terms of power, technology and luxury, the BMW 7 Series, Jaguar XJ and Audi A8 all come close to the S-Class, for thousands less. If your budget is even tighter, there's the Kia K900 or Genesis G90.","Luxury cars claim to be the envy of the world's elite, but those cars envy the 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Acclaimed by CEOs, heads of state, or just those who want to feel like one, the combination of power, technology, luxury, sophistication and exacting attention to detail leaves the S-Class without equal. Are there alternatives? Yes, and the BMW 7 Series, Audi A8 and Lexus LS are all impressive, yet perpetually a step behind the S-Class. This flagship sedan, coupe and new drop-top Cabriolet offer driver-assist aids and luxury trappings that are second to none, justification enough for its nearly $100,000 base price. In its most elite form, the V12-powered AMG S65 impresses beyond reason, while the eco-friendly super-rich can opt for the S550e plug-in hybrid.","There's no question the 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is big, whether it's in sedan, coupe or convertible form.

 If you've ever experienced a luxury spa, you've wondered how you could take the experience with you. Well, here you go. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class offers a hot-stone setting on its multi-contour massaging seats. There's even aromatherapy, courtesy of the glove-box-mounted fragrance atomizer.","","There's the addition of the new coupe-based S-Class Cabriolet convertible, of course. On top of that,","The 2017 S-Class costs a lot, but you get a lot. Of course you get standard leather and wood trim, automatic climate control, and all the expected luxury trappings of a modern luxury car. Standout features include 16-way-power front seats, 13-speaker Burmester audio system that will make you an audiophile if you aren't already, a navigation system and a power rear sunshade. There's also the in-cabin fragrance system. Also standard are all manner of highly advanced safety systems, including autonomous braking at speeds up to 65 mph. Another standard S-Class feature is 24-hour roadside assistance that never expires.","Optional Equipment 
Massaging seats, high-tech safety gear including infrared nighttime-vision, and even a 621-horsepower engine are all available for the S-Class lineup of sedan, coupe or convertible. The safety gear includes Distronic Plus radar-based cruise control and autonomous steering, a combination that comes close to making the car autonomous. You can choose softer leather, your own individual fragrance, 4-zone climate control and mbrace Plus, with apps and access to a Mercedes-Benz concierge. If you plan on being driven in your S-Class sedan instead of driving it, there's the executive seating package, rear-cabin refrigerator, dual-screen entertainment system and power side shades for added privacy.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedans carry a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) ranging from $97,500 for a 2017 S550 sedan to nearly $228,000 for the AMG S65 sedan.

Despite its luxury name and trappings, Mercedes-Benz’s G-Class for 2017 isn’t as comfortable or safe as a Porsche Cayenne or Bentley Bentayga.

Now entering its 38th year of production, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV (better known as the G-Wagen) has seen many improvements since the original, but at its core remains the same rugged beast. Not as refined as a Land Rover Range Rover, nor as spacious as a Cadillac Escalade, the 2017 G-Class confounds logic as the go-to vehicle for the ultra-rich wishing to impress their friends and enemies. Of course, most will never need or use the G-Wagen’s abilities. However, those who do venture off-road will find themselves behind the wheel of one of the world’s most capable off-road warriors.","From a capability standpoint, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV for 2017 will take you almost anywhere you want to go, from a secluded sandy beach to the most...","Favorite Features 
 
UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE
 While most luxury SUVs only hint softly at their off-road ability, the 2017 MB G-Class screams it proudly from the highest peak. You won’t find a sedan-like ride or ultra-quiet cabin in the G-Class, but you will find a tenacious off-roader that will make you the envy of the Moab set.
 
 V12-POWERED AMG G65
 The idea of wedding the track-performance genius of AMG with a nearly 40-year-old SUV might seem like lunacy, but we like it. The twin-turbocharged V12 provides more power than any off-roader could ever want, but on the street it simply furthers the G-Class’s cred.","","Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 G-Class luxury SUV gains a new off-road trim dubbed the G550 4x4. This model is raised 17 inches and widened by nine inches and features portal axles, three locking differentials and a permanent all-wheel-drive system. On the standard G-Class, improvements are limited to smartphone, designo and AMG package upgrades.; While even Range Rovers have softened their lines, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class retains the boxy, upright look it has had for decades. Aerodynamic it's not, but the G-Wagen's design is honest, masculine and pragmatic. At just 187.5 inches long, the G is actually shorter than the Mercedes GLE","Even if you spend the least on a ""base"" G550, you're still getting a luxury SUV befitting its $120,000 price tag. Highlights include power sunroof, dual-zone climate control and Mercedes' COMAND system that bundles navigation, harman/kardon audio system and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Other safety and convenience features include blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, heated and ventilated front seats, and leather and wood interior. Also standard: the intangible confidence/ego gained from driving a vehicle that could crush almost any environment.","Optional Equipment 
The AMG G63 adds a more powerful V8 engine, 20-inch wheels (vs. 19 on the G550), high-performance braking system and sport exhaust and supple designo wood and leather interior. The King Kong AMG G65 boasts a V12 engine, AMG front seats and designo-exclusive Nappa leather interior and 21-inch wheels. Other options include a rear-seat entertainment system with twin LCD monitors, heated steering wheel, and electronically adjustable suspension in the G550. Also available are subscriptions to mbrace, Mercedes' suite of mobile apps, concierge and other services.","Pricing Notes 
 
The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class luxury SUV is over $123,000 for the G550 and over $142,000 for the AMG G63. Pricing for the G550 4x4 has not yet been announced. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz AMG G65 starts just shy of $221,500. Add in the AMG Performance Studio Package, and that's another $20,000 alone. At these prices, the G-Wagen is among the most expensive SUVs out there, but those with money to burn can also easily spend $100,000 to even $200,000 on a super-luxe Range Rover or Porsche Cayenne Turbo.

If you desire a capable, comfortable and confident 2-row SUV from an automaker whose very name is synonymous with luxury, the Mercedes-Benz GLE is an excellent choice. Its diverse lineup and price range of just over $50,000 to more than twice that add to its desirability and level of attainability.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
A Lexus RX has a cushier ride and starts around $10,000 less, while an Acura RDX is even less. If you need to seat more than five, you'll have to step up to a 3-row SUV like the new Mercedes GLS.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE is the new name for the outgoing M-Class, Mercedes' impressive 5-passenger luxury SUV. The new ""GL"" naming convention aims to align Mercedes' expanding SUV lineup, with the GLE paralleling the midsize E-Series sedan. In addition to the fresh nomenclature, the 2016 GLE improves upon the M-Class with updated exterior design, upgraded interior amenities and new technology. The GLE luxury SUV competes well with rivals such as the BMW X5, Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX and Cadillac SRX thanks to its well-rounded nature and diverse powertrain lineup that ranges from an efficient diesel engine and plug-in hybrid to the high-performance AMG variants. (The sportier, less practical GLE Coupe has its own review.)","Given the GLE's variety of powertrains, it's no surprise that each model behaves differently. The GLE300d diesel SUV is the least invigorating, taking nearly nine seconds to reach 60 mph....","Favorite Features 
 
FUEL-EFFICIENT DIESEL ENGINE 
Diesel vehicles have gotten a bad rap lately in light of VW's emissions scandal, but not all should be demonized. The diesel-powered GLE300d uses a small and efficient engine that earns up to 29 mpg on the highway yet has the muscle to tow 6,600 pounds. 
 
OFF-ROAD ENGINEERING PACKAGE 
For the few buyers seeking to get their luxury SUV dirty, this package for the GLE400 is up to the task. It builds on the GLE's standard off-road setting and capabilities with a 2-speed transfer case, locking differential and optional air suspension that can grant 11 inches of ground clearance.","","In addition to its new name, the 2016 Mercedes GLE builds on the outgoing M-Class with updated front and rear aesthetics, new safety features including Crosswind Assist and a revised collision-prevention system. The GLE550e plug-in hybrid SUV is all-new to the lineup.; Though newly named, the GLE's exterior design doesn't differ vastly from the long-running M-Class. Mercedes'","As should be expected from a vehicle costing over $50,000, the 2016 Mercedes GLE comes well-equipped out the gate. The least expensive GLE model, the 350, includes a power tailgate, sunroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and selectable drive modes (Comfort, Sport and Slippery). Audio and communication features include an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio receiver with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, all displayed on an 8-inch color screen. Standard upholstery remains the MB-Tex faux leather. The GLE also comes with Brake Hold, which keeps the brakes applied at a stoplight without the need to keep your foot on the pedal.","Optional Equipment 
From massaging front seats to heated and cooled cupholders and AMG performance parts, there's no shortage of options. Keep in mind, most come at a pretty price. Among the better values is the $3,830 Premium 1 Package for the GLE300d and GLE350 (standard on higher trims) that bundles navigation, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, keyless entry, and the COMAND touch-pad controller. Additional safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist, active cruise control and Steering Assist, which keeps the vehicle from drifting in lanes. We're partial to amenities like a wood-and-leather steering wheel and magical Bang & Olufsen audio.","Pricing Notes 
 
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE midsize luxury SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $52,000 for a RWD GLE350. The AWD GLE350 4MATIC starts a couple grand more, while the diesel GLE300d splits the difference at $53,425. Prices zoom with options and trims. The more powerful GLE400 starts at over $65,000. The chasm is vast between the high-performance AMG GLE63, which begins at over $100,000. The top-dog AMG GLE63 S variant bows at over $108,000, and can go beyond $125,000 with options. At these prices the GLE nearly mimics the BMW X5, but is tens of thousands more than other upscale SUVs such as the Acura RDX, Cadillac SRX, Infiniti QX50, Lexus RX and Audi Q5. Before buying, complete your homework and check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. The Mercedes GLE's resale value is expected to hold up well over the years, but still trail the Lexus RX.

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class remains a cut above its competition in sophistication and luxury, making it an excellent choice for anybody wanting a capable, comfortable and confident 2-row luxury SUV. A starting price just over $50,000 makes it surprisingly attainable as well.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The Lexus RX offers a softer ride and a price tag that's $10,000 lower; the Acura RDX is agile and comfortable, and even less. The GLE is also limited to five passengers; if you need more room, you'll have to step up to a 3-row SUV like the Mercedes GLS.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is practically a full-fledged lineup of luxury SUVs unto itself. There's the GLE350, with its fuel-efficient V6, or the GLE550e hybrid. On the other end is a GLE63 S AMG with more power than you'll know what to do with, and in between, a new GLE43 AMG model that splits the difference in both price and power. If it sounds like there's a GLE for every luxury SUV taste, then you're right-on, as Mercedes-Benz offers a variation to take on everything from the BMW X5, Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX and Cadillac XT5. Its well-rounded nature, roomy and comfortable interior, and diverse powertrain lineup make it a solid choice for luxury SUV buyers. (The sportier, less practical GLE Coupe has its own review.)","All 2017 GLE models are comfortable and easy to drive, whether it's the base GLE350, or the fire-breathing AMG GLE63 S. That means your choices are dictated by engine, and...","Favorite Features 
 
PLUG-IN HYBRID
 The GLE550e offers up to 18 miles of electric-only travel, along with fast charging, and the gasoline engine means no range anxiety. If your daily drive is limited to those miles, or if you can recharge during the day, you could see a dramatic decrease in your gas bill.
 
 Mercedes-AMG GLE43
 While the 2017 AMG GLE43 is not the quickest or greatest handling AMG model to debut, we like its additional power, upgraded looks, enhanced features and (relatively) affordable price point, allowing AMG-intenders a way into the famed sub-brand, but without a 6-digit price tag.","","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE drops the diesel and gains a standard rearview camera, 4G LTE Wi-Fi, and a couple of new colors. There's also a new performance model: the AMG GLE43, which uses a twin-turbo V6 engine.; The styling update last year softened some of the lines, but the 2017 GLE exterior remains boxy, but handsome. We particularly like the angled C-pillar behind the rear doors, and the LED taillights make a statement at night, along with the new LED-accented headlights during the day. Opt for the high-end AMG models, and you'll get 20-inch wheels, a lowered stance, and unique styling accents that include four chrome tailpipes. Roof rails on all models add to the GLE's utility factor.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE comes very nicely equipped, as you'd expect from a vehicle starting at more than $50,000. Highlights include a power tailgate, sunroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and selectable drive modes (Comfort, Sport and Slippery). There are also keyless start, a rearview camera, active brake assist and crosswind assist, and Parking Pilot, which assists you in parking your car, either parallel or perpendicular. Audio and communication features include an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio receiver with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, all displayed on an 8-inch color screen. Standard upholstery remains the MB-Tex faux leather.","Optional Equipment 
Even putting aside the different engine options, there's no shortage of upgrades for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class...as long as you're willing to pay. A Premium 1 Package for the GLE350 (standard on higher trims) bundles navigation, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, keyless entry, and the COMAND touch-pad controller. There are also massaging seats, leather, various wood trim designs, and AMG performance packages. Additional safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist, active cruise control and Steering Assist, which keeps the vehicle from drifting in lanes. We're particularly partial to the downright magical-sounding Bang & Olufsen audio.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE midsize-luxury SUV is a little under $53,000 when you include the $925 destination charge; add another $2,500 if you want 4MATIC all-wheel drive. On the other end of the scale is the roughly $110,000 you'll pay for the AMG GLE63 S. And that's all before options; a fully loaded GLE63 S will run you more than $120,000. Despite a somewhat stiff suspension, the AMG GLE43 offers an excellent compromise of power, fuel economy, performance and features, and it starts at about $68,500. Prices closely match the BMW X5, but the Mercedes-Benz is thousands more than vehicles like the Acura RDX, Cadillac XT5, Lexus RX and more. Before buying, complete your homework and check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. The Mercedes GLE's resale value is expected to hold up well over the years, but still trail the Lexus RX.

If you’re looking for a sleek modern midsize-luxury SUV, but can’t sacrifice function for form, the 2017 MB GLC-Class may be exactly what you’ve been looking for. Mercedes-Benz’s best safety features are all here, as is its reputation for strong resale and reliability.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you’re not a fan of 4-cylinder engines, the Audi Q5 and BMW X5 offer a V6, as does the Lexus RX 350. If you want the latest driver assists and infotainment, you can find them in less expensive cars like the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Subaru Outback Touring.","In a field filled with midsize-luxury SUVs like the Audi Q5 and BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz’s 2017 GLC-Class is a formidable player. Its sleek body is a departure from the angular Mercedes SUVs of the past, and its interior sets a new standard for design and execution. In its most demure form, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 241 horsepower. Connected to a 9-speed automatic, this engine delivers both power and economy worthy of the 3-pointed star. However, if that’s not good enough, there’s the new AMG GLC43 that cranks out 362 horsepower. Need something a bit more personal? The GLC Coupe has a more rounded silhouette while retaining the convenience of having four doors.","From behind the wheel, it’s not hard to feel a big dose of the C-Class in the GLC300’s ride and handling characteristics. Acceleration is strong and steady, if not swift,...","Favorite Features 
 
AIR BODY CONTROL
 With the air-suspension setup in the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class luxury SUV, you’ll get a softer ride, the ability to raise or lower the vehicle’s ride height via the Dynamic Select Mode and even have the ability make the GLC “kneel” for easier loading of cargo or pets.
 
 DESIGNO INTERIOR
 Luxury used to be defined by leather seats and power windows, but not anymore. If you truly want your 2017 GLC to stand out in a crowd, the Designo interior option weds leather, color and quilted seat patterns to create an interior that is truly sumptuous, not to mention expensive.","The 2017 GLC is about two inches wider and five inches longer than the old GLK it replaced last year, translating to more shoulder room, and an extra 2.2 inches of rear legroom. Cargo room increases by 17 percent, with an easy-to-reach load floor and plenty of storage under the cargo floor, since there's no spare tire taking up room (the GLC uses run-flat tires). There's also a lot more storage space, with a bigger glove box, bigger center console bin and bigger door pockets. The C-Class-inspired dash looks great and is easy to use, and comfortable seating awaits every passenger.","","The 2017 GLC300 offers a solid array of standard equipment. Beyond the power driver's seat with memory, automatic climate control, power-folding mirrors, a power tailgate and rearview camera, the GLC-Class comes with things like the Mercedes-Benz touch pad for using the infotainment system. There's a solid set of safety systems, featuring Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe, which help prevent and mitigate the effects of collisions. Crosswind Assist helps keep the GLC from being blown around by winds. The GLC Coupe adds 4Matic all-wheel drive and a power sunroof, while the AMG trim gains a twin-turbo V6, Keyless-Go and an AMG-tuned suspension.","Optional Equipment 
Mercedes-Benz doesn't skimp on the options for its latest midsize-luxury SUV, with plentiful option packages that let you equip your GLC pretty much any way you want. There's the high-end Designo interior and exterior, of course, but there's also available leather, upgraded wood trims, and a variety of interior colors to choose from. Option packages include the Premium 2 package that adds COMAND navigation, a Sport package that gives the GLC300 an AMG-inspired look, and a driver-assistance package that includes adaptive cruise control, active blind-spot and lane-keeping assist and steering assist. On top of it all, there's the high-spirited AMG GLC43 model.","Under the Hood 
 
While diesel and hybrid models are planned, currently there are only two engines available for the GLC-Class. In the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder produces a healthy 241 horsepower and can be had with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). Mercedes-Benz says the GLC is fully off-road capable, although we'd still recommend taking it easy, as die-hard off-roaders will immediately note the lack of a low-speed transfer case. The GLC300 Coupe comes standard with 4Matic all-wheel drive, while the AMG GLC43 ups the ante with a 362-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6 teamed with 4Matic.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (GLC300, Coupe)
 241 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg (RWD), 21/28 mpg (AWD)
 
 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (AMG GLC43)
 362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm
 384 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-4,500 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/24
 
Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
A rear-wheel-drive 2017 GLC300 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $40,000, while AWD adds $2,000 to the total. Options add up quickly though, with some packages -- such as the $2,500 interior package with leather upholstery -- requiring other packages, in this case, the $1,830 Premium Package. Start adding in Designo upholstery and paint, and you're well on your way to $65,000. However, more judicious option selection can keep the price right around $50,000, and still retain leather seats, adaptive cruise control and navigation. The AMG GLC43 starts around $56,000. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, the GLC300 holds its value well, slightly better than the Audi Q5, much better than the BMW X5 but still well behind the Lexus RX350.

Love the look and feel of a wagon but not the stigma or limited availability? The 2016 GLA compact-crossover SUV from Mercedes-Benz is the perfect solution. Available all-wheel drive makes the GLA the perfect year-round companion, while the AMG version should satisfy the most demanding enthusiast.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you want a sporty-looking compact-luxury SUV, but you also need the ability to go off-road and carry lots of cargo and people, a Land Rover Evoque, BMW X3 or even a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk makes a better choice.","With compact-luxury crossover SUVs like the BMW X1 and Lexus NX roaming freely, it was only a matter of time before Mercedes-Benz jumped into the fray. With the 2016 GLA, MB has produced a sub-$35,000 compact-luxury crossover SUV that obliterates the field with its stunning good looks, powerful engine options and surprisingly roomy interior. Sharing its engines and underpinnings with the popular CLA sedan, the GLA250 and GLA45 AMG depart from the Audi A3, Land Rover Evoque and BMW X1 by creating a silhouette more wagon-like than SUV. As such, the GLA appeals more to driving enthusiasts with light off-road needs rather than the “outdoor lifestyle” crowd so over-represented in most marketing campaigns.","Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA250 luxury-crossover SUV is the kind of vehicle that prompts fights over who gets the driver’s seat and who rides shotgun, and there’s even more to love when...","Favorite Features

Although you probably won’t be taking the 2016 MB GLA250 to the Rubicon Trail, the standard Hill Descent Control is a nice feature to have when creeping down a snow-covered hill or the occasional dirt trail. 
 
PANORAMA SUNROOF 
A panoramic sunroof can help open an otherwise claustrophobic cabin, but when fitted to a vehicle the size of Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 GLA compact-luxury SUV, it practically makes one feel like they’re driving a convertible.","","For 2016, the GLA250 gains keyless start, dual-zone climate control, Dynamic Select drive modes and an upgraded infotainment system.

Available convenience items include blind-spot assistance, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, and park assist, which helps find a parking spot and takes the reins by steering the GLA into the open space.","Pricing Notes 
 
In front-drive form, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 compact-crossover SUV starts just under $33,500, with the AWD version about $2,000 above that. At that mark, the GLA represents a solid value considering its quality interior and generous standard equipment. If you don’t mind keeping it somewhat simple by forgoing expensive options, you should be able to purchase a new GLA for less than you might think. The AMG version commands around $50,000, but the sportier model also delivers a fiercer, more mature driving experience.

If you're looking for something more akin to a sports-car experience, the new SLC43 delivers.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
This is not a car for the tall, and if you're mistaken for an NBA star, you're going to find the SLC a tight fit. Despite the additional power in the SLC43, it's still not quite the sports car the BMW Z4 or Porsche Boxster is.","First things first: The 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC is what we used to call the SLK; blame the Mercedes nomenclature realignment strategy for the new badge. However, credit the company's AMG division for the real news: the introduction of the 2017 Mercedes-AMG SLC43. With a 362-horsepower 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 driving the rear wheels, the new SLC43 transforms the SLC from a fun roadster into something approximating a luxurious muscle car. But even the standard SLC300 is no slouch, and we're not just talking about the powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. With a power hardtop, a comfortable ride and the luxury inherent to the Mercedes-Benz brand, the SLC is a comfortable and luxurious alternative to the BMW Z4, Audi TT and Porsche Boxster.","To be clear, we're fans of the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that's standard issue in the 2017 SLC300. Smooth, powerful and refined, you'll bet real money that it puts out more...","Favorite Features 
 
MAGIC SKY CONTROL
 Lots of convertibles these days have retractable hardtops. However, they don't have the Mercedes-Benz exclusive Magic Sky Control. With a push of a button, the glass in the roof panel goes from opaque to clear, giving you the feeling of open-air driving without the mussed hairdo.
 
 AIRSCARF & AIR GUIDES
 It's fun to drive a convertible on a cold day, but not if you're getting chilled. To keep you warm, the SLC-Class has adjustable Air Guide draft deflectors on each rollbar, and the Airscarf system to blow warm air on your neck from an outlet in the headrest.","Mercedes-Benz is a luxury-car maker, so it's no surprise that's the biggest strength of the 2017 SLC. Whether covered in MB-Tex faux leather or real hides, the seats are comfortable, even though there's not a lot of room for taller drivers. Audio and climate controls are as easily accessed as they are easy to use, and we love the satisfying tactile quality of the knobs and switches. The top features a panorama roof, so even when it's up you have a view of the sky. The very cool (but goofy-sounding) Magic Sky Control option lets you adjust the depth of tint.","With the hardtop up, the 2017 SLC-Class looks a lot like a coupe, albeit a somewhat awkward one thanks to the cap-like way the roof sits over the passenger compartment. Still you'd be hard pressed to tell it's actually a convertible unless you see it with the top down, and then you're in for more of a visual treat. Its long hood, short trunk and wide stance give the SLC that classic roadster look. That top retracts in only 20 seconds, too. Overall the car is small, just a bit bigger than a","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 comes standard with a 5.8-inch infotainment display, an 8-speaker audio system with a USB port and Bluetooth streaming, auto-dimming mirrors and 8-way-power seats. The roof comes with a standard glass panel for a panoramic view, and there's an Eco mode that includes automatic start/stop to help save a few drops of fuel at stoplights. An attention-assist feature monitors the driver for drowsiness, and there are active head restraints, stability control, lots of air bags, and dual roll hoops to keep you safe.","Optional Equipment 
Beyond the AMG goodness that comes with the SLC43, options are bundled into different groups. The Premium 1 package adds the Airscarf, heated seats, keyless ignition and entry, and remote hardtop operation, all while upgrading the audio system. A Premium 2 package adds active high beams, brighter headlights, navigation, dual-zone climate control, and more. The Premium 3 package includes everything from Premium 1 and 2, and adds active cruise control and lane-keeping assist, parking assist and an adaptive suspension. Stand-alone options include the Magic Sky Control roof, and if you want extreme customization, there's the Designo exterior and interior trim.","Under the Hood 
 
The standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder under the hood of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 puts out 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, sending it to the rear wheels through a 9-speed automatic transmission. That's on par with the base engine in the BMW Z4. The Mercedes-AMG SLC43 is the sole powertrain upgrade, but it's a good one: 362 horsepower from a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6, good for a 0-60-mph time of about 4.6 seconds. It too uses a 9-speed automatic. The 3.5-liter V6 and 5.5-liter V8 models from last year have disappeared in favor of the new AMG. Note that both the SLC300 and the SLC43 require at least 91 octane fuel.
 
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4
 241 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-4,000 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/32 mpg
 
 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6
 362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm
 384 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,200 rpm
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/29 mpg
 
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.","Pricing Notes 
 
Include the $925 destination charge, and the base-model 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 starts at about $49,000, which isn't too bad. However, those option packages add up quickly, and with the Premium 3 package, you'll add about $10,000 to the bottom line. The Mercedes-AMG SLC43 starts a little over the $61,000 mark, and the same thing applies as far as options go. However, as pricey as that sounds, the SLC still undercuts its primary BMW Z4 competitor by a couple thousand dollars, and it's practically a bargain compared to the considerably more expensive Porsche Boxster. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price before buying to see what others are paying for their new Mercedes roadster. The 2017 SLC's resale value should be good, with 4-cylinder variants predicted to best hold their value, but still match the Porsche Boxster.

The GLE Coupe's unique design and athletic performance come at a cost. Beyond its $66,000-plus starting price – $14,000 above the standard GLE – the Coupe has less interior room, worse outward visibility, and the choice of only two powertrains. As for its looks, we're being polite in calling it ""unique.""","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is the sporty counterpart to the standard GLE SUV. And though its name differs by only one word, the Coupe variant is far different. Like its rival the BMW X6, the GLE Coupe trades the practicality of the vehicle on which it's based for a sweeping design and athletic performance. Also similar to the X5-drived X6, Mercedes insists on using the word ""Coupe"" despite this vehicle's four doors and taller, SUV-like stance. The GLE Coupe further distinguishes itself from the GLE by offering only two turbocharged gasoline engines, a V6 or voracious V8 in the high-performance GLE63 S Coupe. As with its BMW rival, the Mercedes GLE Coupe caters to luxury buyers who prioritize design and individuality over everyday practicality.","With only two models, the GLE Coupe's manners are less varied than that of the standard GLE, whose lineup spans from a diesel-powered SUV to a gas-electric hybrid....","Favorite Features

One could make that case that if you have the means to indulge in the less-practical GLE Coupe, you may as well spend over six figures for the top-line version. While testing this beast in twisting, high-speed roads in Germany, we couldn't help smiling at its ridiculous power and grip. 
 
MASSAGING FRONT SEATS 
Few automotive options say indulgence quite like massaging front seats, and Mercedes makes some of the finest. The front pair in the GLE Coupe allow for adjustment of intensity, placement and more, all of which can reduce fatigue and promote relaxation.","","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is all-new. Based on the GLE that replaced the M-Class, this 4-door, 5-passenger; If there is any confusion between the Coupe and the standard GLE, it takes but a glance to see they are vastly different. Whereas the GLE retains the blocky, rugged good looks of the Mercedes M-Class SUV it replaces, the all-new GLE Coupe is all curves. Its profile is similar to the X6, with a downward-sweeping roofline that limits cargo space inside and compromises outward visibility. Nonconformist automotive design has long led to such compromises, but we're not sure the tradeoffs are worth it for the GLE Coupe. Its rear can appear bulbous and its overall shape awkward. You be the judge.","As expected from a high-end Mercedes-Benz, the GLE450 AMG Coupe comes with a bevy of premium amenities. Included are heated and power-operated front seats (base material is still the MB-Tex faux leather, though), power liftgate, power-adjustable steering wheel, navigation, rearview camera, dual-zone climate control and 21-inch wheels. Standard infotainment includes an AM/FM/CD/DVD system with Bluetooth streaming, USB/SD inputs and HD Radio and Mercedes' COMAND touch-pad control system and 8-inch display. The AMG GLE63 S adds a brawny V8, Nappa leather seating, active parking assist, blind-spot monitoring, panorama roof, harman/kardon premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats and surround-view/rearview camera.","Optional Equipment 
As is customary for Mercedes, the list of options and packages for the new GLE Coupe crossover SUV is extensive and expensive. Extras range from a Convenience package with soft-close doors and heated/cooled cup holders to those massaging seats we raved about in Favorite Things. Optional safety and driving aids include active lane-keeping assist, dynamic cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. In addition to the harman/kardon premium audio system that is standard in the GLE63 S and optional in the GLE450 AMG, an ultra-premium Bang & Olufsen system is available.","Pricing Notes

The GLE Coupe goes against the likes of the BMW X6 by offering a sleeker body and better driving dynamics than the SUV upon which it's based. The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is the sporty counterpart to the standard GLE SUV. Don't expect much utility from this SUV though, as the GLE Coupe puts a priority on design.","There are two ways to drive the 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe, be it in GLE43 or GLE63. One is as a Mercedes-Benz, with the Dynamic Select set to Comfort mode,...","Favorite Features 
 
DYNAMIC SELECT
 With a twist of the dial, the 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe goes from a comfortable cruiser for around town to a stiff-legged, sharp-steering, growling and roaring sport machine. While the suspension is on the too-stiff side, an Individual mode lets you pick and choose which of the higher-performance characteristics you want.
 
 MASSAGING FRONT SEATS
 This is a pure indulgence, we admit, but then again, this is a luxury car so why not? The available massaging seats in the Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe allow for adjustment of intensity, placement and more, all of which can reduce fatigue and promote relaxation.","","The 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe becomes an AMG product this year, with both versions wearing the AMG badge. The GLE43 is new this year, sporting an improved twin-turbo V6 engine and other upgrades to bring it more firmly into the AMG fold.","Beyond the ""AMG enhanced"" everything -- ranging from the transmission to the steering to the suspension and all-wheel drive -- the base GLE43 offers heated and power-operated front seats covered in MB-Tex faux leather, a power liftgate, power-adjustable steering wheel, navigation, rearview camera, dual-zone climate control and 21-inch wheels. The standard audio system includes Bluetooth streaming, USB/SD inputs and HD Radio, all operated through a Mercedes' COMAND touch-pad control system and 8-inch display. Opt for the more powerful AMG GLE63 S and you get Nappa leather seating, active parking assist, blind-spot monitoring, and a harman/kardon premium audio system, along with the powerful V8.","Optional Equipment 
There's the bigger engine of course, in the GLE63 S Coupe, along with the aforementioned upgraded features. As for standalone options, there's a cornucopia ranging from a Convenience package with soft-close doors and heated/cooled cup holders, to those massaging seats we raved about in Favorite Features. Optional safety and driving aids include active lane-keeping assist, dynamic cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. In addition to the harman/kardon premium audio system that is standard in the GLE63 S, an ultra-premium Bang & Olufsen system is available.","Pricing Notes 
 
The base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLE43 Coupe starts at about the $70,600 mark, about $15,000 beyond the standard GLE SUV. Step up from there to the GLE63 S Coupe, and you're looking at a starting price of more than $111,500. That's a stretch, and options add even more, with $120,000 and beyond possible on the GLE63 S without even trying. Note that these prices actually put the GLE Coupe higher than its main rival, the BMW X6 and the X6 M. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Mercedes SUV. As it is an all-new, niche model, the GLE Coupe's resale value in the years ahead is still an unknown.

If you need to seat more than five, you'll have to step up to a 3-row SUV like the new Mercedes GLS.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE is the new name for the outgoing M-Class, Mercedes' impressive 5-passenger luxury SUV. The new ""GL"" naming convention aims to align Mercedes' expanding SUV lineup, with the GLE paralleling the midsize E-Series sedan. In addition to the fresh nomenclature, the 2016 GLE improves upon the M-Class with updated exterior design, upgraded interior amenities and new technology. The GLE luxury SUV competes well with rivals such as the BMW X5, Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX and Cadillac SRX thanks to its well-rounded nature and diverse powertrain lineup that ranges from an efficient diesel engine and plug-in hybrid to the high-performance AMG variants. (The sportier, less practical GLE Coupe has its own review.)","Given the GLE's variety of powertrains, it's no surprise that each model behaves differently. The GLE300d diesel SUV is the least invigorating, taking nearly nine seconds to reach 60 mph....","Favorite Features 
 
FUEL-EFFICIENT DIESEL ENGINE 
Diesel vehicles have gotten a bad rap lately in light of VW's emissions scandal, but not all should be demonized. The diesel-powered GLE300d uses a small and efficient engine that earns up to 29 mpg on the highway yet has the muscle to tow 6,600 pounds. 
 
OFF-ROAD ENGINEERING PACKAGE 
For the few buyers seeking to get their luxury SUV dirty, this package for the GLE400 is up to the task. It builds on the GLE's standard off-road setting and capabilities with a 2-speed transfer case, locking differential and optional air suspension that can grant 11 inches of ground clearance.","All GLE models are 2-row, 5-passenger SUVs. This SUV's boxy exterior design translates to very respectable room within. There is ample rear-seat leg room, and cargo room starts at 38.2 cubic feet with the rear seats upright and more than doubles to over 80 cubic feet with them folded. The exception is the plug-in hybrid, which loses rear cargo space since it houses the lithium-ion battery pack. Front seats are supportive and grant a commanding view out. Climate and audio controls are easy to use once you determine where they are – buttons are on the small side and somewhat crowded.","Though newly named, the GLE's exterior design doesn't differ vastly from the long-running M-Class. Mercedes'","As should be expected from a vehicle costing over $50,000, the 2016 Mercedes GLE comes well-equipped out the gate. The least expensive GLE model, the 350, includes a power tailgate, sunroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and selectable drive modes (Comfort, Sport and Slippery). Audio and communication features include an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio receiver with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, all displayed on an 8-inch color screen. Standard upholstery remains the MB-Tex faux leather. The GLE also comes with Brake Hold, which keeps the brakes applied at a stoplight without the need to keep your foot on the pedal.","Optional Equipment 
From massaging front seats to heated and cooled cupholders and AMG performance parts, there's no shortage of options. Keep in mind, most come at a pretty price. Among the better values is the $3,830 Premium 1 Package for the GLE300d and GLE350 (standard on higher trims) that bundles navigation, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera, keyless entry, and the COMAND touch-pad controller.

As noted, several engines are available for the 2016 Mercedes GLE, including a small but torque-rich diesel, a pair of gasoline V6s, a strong and stronger pair of turbocharged V8s, and a plug-in hybrid. All models use a 7-speed transmission that pairs well with all six of the GLE's available powertrains. All models except the base GLE350 are 4MATIC – Mercedes' lingo for all-wheel drive (AWD). The base GLE350 is rear-wheel drive (RWD). The GLE has impressive towing ability that ranges from 6,600 to 7,200 pounds. The diesel GLE uses injections of AdBlue to reduce harmful emissions, and gasoline models like to drink premium unleaded. The plug-in hybrid GLE has an 18-mile electric-only range and can be recharged in a couple hours on a 220-volt outlet.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE midsize luxury SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $52,000 for a RWD GLE350. The AWD GLE350 4MATIC starts a couple grand more, while the diesel GLE300d splits the difference at $53,425. Prices zoom with options and trims. The more powerful GLE400 starts at over $65,000. The chasm is vast between the high-performance AMG GLE63, which begins at over $100,000. The top-dog AMG GLE63 S variant bows at over $108,000, and can go beyond $125,000 with options.

 The GLE550e offers up to 18 miles of electric-only travel, along with fast charging, and the gasoline engine means no range anxiety. If your daily drive is limited to those miles, or if you can recharge during the day, you could see a dramatic decrease in your gas bill.
 
 Mercedes-AMG GLE43
 While the 2017 AMG GLE43 is not the quickest or greatest handling AMG model to debut, we like its additional power, upgraded looks, enhanced features and (relatively) affordable price point, allowing AMG-intenders a way into the famed sub-brand, but without a 6-digit price tag.","Last year, the GLE got a major upgrade to its interior, changes that carry through to 2017. All 2017 GLE models are 2-row SUVs that can seat five passengers and carry a respectable 38.2 cubic feet of cargo behind the rear seats. The GLE550e loses a bit of its cargo space thanks to the big lithium-ion battery pack. Regardless, all GLE models offer exceptionally comfortable front seats and equally satisfying rear seats. Like all modern luxury cars there are a lot of features, which means something of a learning curve, but easy enough to find and use after that.","The styling update last year softened some of the lines, but the 2017 GLE exterior remains boxy, but handsome. We particularly like the angled C-pillar behind the rear doors, and the LED taillights make a statement at night, along with the new LED-accented headlights during the day. Opt for the high-end AMG models, and you'll get 20-inch wheels, a lowered stance, and unique styling accents that include four chrome tailpipes. Roof rails on all models add to the GLE's utility factor.","The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE comes very nicely equipped, as you'd expect from a vehicle starting at more than $50,000.

Standard high-tech features include collision avoidance, crosswind assist, keyless ignition and a Dynamic Select control that lets the driver switch between various drive modes. But beyond that, the new GLC is bigger in every dimension, to give more space for passengers, driver and cargo, but also to put more space between it and last year's new addition, the GLA-Class subcompact-luxury SUV.","The new Mercedes-Benz GLC feels a lot like the new C-Class from behind the wheel, and that's a good thing.

AIR BODY CONTROL 
The new air suspension on the 2016 GLC-Class promises a lot. For example, a smoother ride, adjustable ride height when using Sport or Sport+ Dynamic Select modes, and even a ""kneeling"" feature that will allow you to lower the rear of the GLC to make it easier to load cargo. 
 
DESIGNO INTERIOR 
If you have a high bar for a Mercedes-Benz interior – and plenty of money to make it happen – then the available Designo interior on the 2016 GLC is just what you need. Premium leather stitched in a quilt pattern, and even matte-paint finishes are available.","The 2016 GLC is about two inches wider and five inches longer than the GLK, translating to more shoulder room, and an extra 2.2 inches of rear legroom. Cargo room increases by 17 percent, with an easy-to-reach load floor and plenty of storage under the cargo floor, since there's no spare tire taking up room (the GLC uses run-flat tires). There's also a lot more storage space, with a bigger glove box, bigger center console bin and bigger door pockets. The C-Class-inspired dash looks great and is easy to use, and comfortable seating awaits every passenger.","Mercedes’ new GLC-Class is noticeably larger than the GLK, but in a good way. Rather than looking ponderous or unwieldy, it looks substantial and solid, although the smooth curves and soft lines are a little less distinctive than the GLK's sharp creases. Still, there's no arguing that the Mercedes-Benz design aesthetic that debuted on the S-Class translates nicely to this midsize-luxury SUV, and Mercedes-Benz arguably has the best-looking SUV lineup among the big three European luxury brands. Wheel sizes vary from the standard 18 inch to 20 inch, and if you like matte-paint finishes, Designo has you covered.","The 2016 GLC300 offers a solid array of standard equipment. Beyond things like power driver's seat with memory, automatic climate control, power-folding mirrors, a power tailgate and rearview camera, the new GLC-Class comes with things like the Mercedes-Benz touch pad for using the infotainment system. There's also a solid set of safety systems, featuring Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe, which help prevent and mitigate the effects of collisions. Crosswind Assist helps keep the GLC from being blown around by winds. There's also the standard Dynamic Select, which gives drivers driving modes from Eco through Sport+, tailoring throttle and transmission response.","Optional Equipment 
Mercedes-Benz doesn't skimp on the options for its new midsize-luxury SUV, and thanks to various option packages and individual options, you can equip your GLC pretty much any way you want. There's the high-end Designo interior and exterior, of course, but there's also available leather, upgraded wood trims, and a variety of interior colors to choose from. Option packages include a Multimedia package that adds COMAND navigation, a Sport package that gives the GLC an AMG-inspired look, and a driver-assistance package that includes adaptive cruise control, active blind spot and lane-keeping assist and steering assist.","Under the Hood 
 
While a diesel and hybrid model are planned, currently the only engine available in the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Its 241 horsepower is less than the V6 from the GLK it replaces, but with the same 273 lb-ft of torque, a 9-speed automatic transmission, and 200 fewer pounds to deal with, the 2016 GLC300 offers up acceleration that's on par with its predecessor. Rear- and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) are both available, and Mercedes-Benz says the GLC is fully off-road capable, although we'd still recommend taking it easy, as die-hard off-roaders will immediately note the lack of a low-speed transfer case.

A rear-wheel-drive 2016 GLC300 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) under $40,000, while AWD adds $2,000 to the total. That's more than the GLK, but the GLC also adds a considerable amount of standard equipment, making it something of a wash. Options add up quickly though, with some packages – such as the $2,500 interior package with leather upholstery – requiring other packages, in this case, the $1,850 Premium Package. Start adding in Designo upholstery and paint, and you're well on your way to $65,000 for your new GLC-Class. However, more judicious option selection can keep the price right around $50,000, and still retain leather seats, adaptive cruise control and navigation. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. Also, the GLK is a Best Resale Value award winner, and we'd expect the GLC to similarly hold its value.

If you want the characteristics of an SUV – all-wheel drive, taller ride height and improved cargo capacity – blended with the design cues and performance attributes of a luxury-sports sedan, the Mercedes GLE Coupe is worth a look.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
The GLE Coupe's unique design and athletic performance come at a cost. Beyond its $66,000-plus starting price – $14,000 above the standard GLE – the Coupe has less interior room, worse outward visibility, and the choice of only two powertrains. As for its looks, we're being polite in calling it ""unique.""","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is the sporty counterpart to the standard GLE SUV. And though its name differs by only one word, the Coupe variant is far different. Like its rival the BMW X6, the GLE Coupe trades the practicality of the vehicle on which it's based for a sweeping design and athletic performance. Also similar to the X5-drived X6, Mercedes insists on using the word ""Coupe"" despite this vehicle's four doors and taller, SUV-like stance. The GLE Coupe further distinguishes itself from the GLE by offering only two turbocharged gasoline engines, a V6 or voracious V8 in the high-performance GLE63 S Coupe. As with its BMW rival, the Mercedes GLE Coupe caters to luxury buyers who prioritize design and individuality over everyday practicality.","With only two models, the GLE Coupe's manners are less varied than that of the standard GLE, whose lineup spans from a diesel-powered SUV to a gas-electric hybrid....","Favorite Features 
 
AMG GLE63 S 
One could make that case that if you have the means to indulge in the less-practical GLE Coupe, you may as well spend over six figures for the top-line version. While testing this beast in twisting, high-speed roads in Germany, we couldn't help smiling at its ridiculous power and grip. 
 
MASSAGING FRONT SEATS 
Few automotive options say indulgence quite like massaging front seats, and Mercedes makes some of the finest. The front pair in the GLE Coupe allow for adjustment of intensity, placement and more, all of which can reduce fatigue and promote relaxation.","Like the standard GLE, the Coupe has a 5-passenger, 2-row layout. However, the GLE Coupe's interior isn't as roomy, a result of its downward sweeping roof and curvy vs. boxy shape. At 23 cubic feet, cargo capacity behind the rear seats isn't terrible, but it's far less than the 38-plus found in the GLE. True to its name, the GLE Coupe is more comfortable for a pair of well-heeled passengers than, say, a family of five. Fit/finish is Mercedes-elegant, but rear visibility is hampered, and adjustments for some amenities like multi-way-power seats require going through awkward on-screen sub-menus.","If there is any confusion between the Coupe and the standard GLE, it takes but a glance to see they are vastly different. Whereas the GLE retains the blocky, rugged good looks of the Mercedes M-Class SUV it replaces, the all-new GLE Coupe is all curves. Its profile is similar to the X6, with a downward-sweeping roofline that limits cargo space inside and compromises outward visibility. Nonconformist automotive design has long led to such compromises, but we're not sure the tradeoffs are worth it for the GLE Coupe. Its rear can appear bulbous and its overall shape awkward. You be the judge.","As expected from a high-end Mercedes-Benz, the GLE450 AMG Coupe comes with a bevy of premium amenities. Included are heated and power-operated front seats (base material is still the MB-Tex faux leather, though), power liftgate, power-adjustable steering wheel, navigation, rearview camera, dual-zone climate control and 21-inch wheels. Standard infotainment includes an AM/FM/CD/DVD system with Bluetooth streaming, USB/SD inputs and HD Radio and Mercedes' COMAND touch-pad control system and 8-inch display. The AMG GLE63 S adds a brawny V8, Nappa leather seating, active parking assist, blind-spot monitoring, panorama roof, harman/kardon premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats and surround-view/rearview camera.","Optional Equipment 
As is customary for Mercedes, the list of options and packages for the new GLE Coupe crossover SUV is extensive and expensive. Extras range from a Convenience package with soft-close doors and heated/cooled cup holders to those massaging seats we raved about in Favorite Things. Optional safety and driving aids include active lane-keeping assist, dynamic cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. In addition to the harman/kardon premium audio system that is standard in the GLE63 S and optional in the GLE450 AMG, an ultra-premium Bang & Olufsen system is available.","Under the Hood 
 
A choice of two turbocharged gasoline engines is available for the 2016 GLE Coupe, and which you get depends on trim. The GLE450 AMG Coupe uses a V6, while the AMG GLE63 S packs a voracious V8. The GLE450 uses a 9-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 GLE Coupe is linked to a 7-speed. Both models are 4Matic, which is Mercedes' lingo for all-wheel drive (AWD). In this case the AWD isn't for rugged off-roading but for enhanced traction in foul weather and better performance in general. Towing may not be top of mind in a GLE Coupe, but a Class III trailer hitch is available to make use of this Mercedes' 7,200-pound tow capacity.

With a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting over $66,000, the 2016 Mercedes GLE Coupe is priced $14,000 beyond the standard GLE SUV. The gap between the two Coupe models is even wider, with the AMG GLE63 S beginning at over $110,000. Go full-boat, and the GLE63 S can stretch beyond $120,000. At these prices, the GLE Coupe is priced higher than its main rival, the BMW X6. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Mercedes SUV. As it is an all-new, niche model, the GLE Coupe's resale value in the years ahead is still an unknown.

With a lineage dating back six decades to the 300SL, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL grants instant access to an iconic automobile. Unlike its race-bred ancestors, this 6th-generation SL coddles with amenities like massaging seats, neck heaters and technology that does everything from integrate with phone apps to automatically stop the car.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you itch for a sizzling performance car that will attack twisty roads or the track, go with the more dynamic Porsche 911 or the Jaguar F-Type, which also offer all-wheel drive (AWD). Drivers desiring more exclusivity can find it in convertible variants of the Bentley Continental and Aston Martin Vanquish.","The SL-Class is Mercedes-Benz's flagship roadster, a 2-passenger chariot that symbolizes success. While other luxury convertibles such as the Porsche 911 and Aston Martin Vanquish Volante may be viewed as play toys for the well-heeled, the 2016 Mercedes SL makes a better case for everyday livability thanks to its folding hardtop and cadre of comfort-focused amenities. Not to say the SL is a slouch. Even the $85,000-plus ""base"" model -- the V6-powered SL400 -- is potent. For those who want to make a bigger impact when they roll into the country club (with over 13 cubic feet with top up, the trunk can swallow two golf bags), there are the AMG performance models, including the V12-powered SL65 with over 600 horsepower and roughly $220,000 price tag.","Despite offering up to 621 horsepower and a ridiculous 738 lb-ft of torque in the top-dog AMG SL65, the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is designed more as a grand touring machine than...","Favorite Features 
 
BITURBO V6 ENGINE
 Not that Mercedes-Benz buyers are necessarily bargain shopping, but there's no question that a less expensive SL is a good thing. Introduced last year, the Mercedes-Benz SL400's twin-turbo V6 engine offers plenty of horsepower for nearly 5-second acceleration to 60 mph, at a price that's over $20,000 less than the V8 model.
 
 MAGIC SKY CONTROL
 Goofy name aside, the Magic Sky Control is one of the coolest things we've seen. At the touch of a button, the panorama roof panel on the SL's hard convertible top goes from opaque to transparent, giving you all the joys of sunshine on your shoulder, but without messing your hair.","","With a mid-cycle refresh around the corner for the 2017 Mercedes SL, changes are minimal for the 2016 version. They include more power for the SL550, five years’ complimentary service for mbrace telematics service, and a Mille Miglia 417 edition limited to just 400 models.; Unlike the BMW 6 Series convertible and even its own sibling the E-Class Cabriolet, Mercedes-Benz's flagship drop-top doesn't have rear seats. This translates to a 10-inch-shorter length than the BMW and a better-proportioned design. Yet despite its modern style, the SL is conscious of its heritage, boasting a long roof and short trunklid. The grille, with its centrally mounted star, evokes the original 1950s’ Gullwing, while the contoured sheet metal, bi-xenon headlights with LED accents and fender-filling 18-inch wheels are solidly 21st century. The SL looks elegant, top up or down. AMG variants flaunt staggered 19- and 20-inch wheels and twin-outlet tailpipes.","You'd expect even the $85,000 base-model Mercedes-Benz SL400 to be generously equipped, and you'd be right. Leather upholstery is standard, as are heated 12-way-power seats with memory, and a power wind-blocker to help minimize wind-mussed hair. Also standard is Mercedes-Benz's COMAND system with navigation, Bluetooth and satellite radio running through the harman/kardon audio system. The V8 models offer as standard equipment, Mercedes' Airscarf neck-level heating system, driver-selectable adaptive suspension and a hands-free system to open the trunk. Also notable are the Active Multi-contour seats with massaging function, plus heating and ventilation. The SL63 and SL65 AMG models feature AMG styling adornments.","Optional Equipment 
There are many ways to make the Mercedes SL more pleasing, starting with the aforementioned Magic Sky Control. You can also add a wonderful-sounding Bang & Olufsen audio system. One very cool feature is the Splitview center screen, which allows the driver to see navigation instructions, and the passenger to watch a movie, all on the same screen at the same time. There are also upgrades to the wood-and-leather interior trim, plus a Driver Assist Package that bundles blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and radar-based cruise control. If that's still not enough, there are the Designo-commissioned treatments for a bespoke experience.","Pricing Notes 
 
With the introduction of the SL400, Mercedes' iconic roadster became attainable for less than six figures, but at nearly $86,000 (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price/MSRP), it's anything but cheap. Prices only scale from there, with the SL550 starting just shy of $109,000 and the AMG SL63 at over $150,000. At nearly $220,000 when factoring in the gas-guzzler fee, the AMG SL65 is among the priciest Mercedes-Benz models you can buy. Thousands more can easily be applied to these figures with options. With such a wide range of prices, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class competes with luxury and ultra-luxury convertibles ranging from the Porsche 911 to the Bentley Continental. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Mercedes-Benz SL's resale value is predicted to be quite poor, and at these prices depreciation costs bring the value down quickly.

Although the new SL is fast by any definition, if you itch for a sizzler that will attack twisty roads or the track, go with the more dynamic Porsche 911 or Jaguar F-Type, which also offer all-wheel drive. Drivers desiring more exclusivity can look to the Bentley Continental and Aston Martin Vanquish.","Since the 1950s the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class has defined the luxury 2-seat convertible. The new 2017 Mercedes SL remains the brand’s flagship roadster and an undeniable international symbol of success. Luxury convertibles such as the Porsche 911 and Aston Martin Vanquish Volante may be viewed as play toys for the well-heeled, but it’s the 2017 Mercedes SL that delivers more civility and everyday livability thanks to its folding hardtop and comfort-focused amenities. Even the $88,000-plus ""base"" model, the V6-powered SL450, is potent. If you want to make a bigger impact at the country club (with over 13 cubic feet with top up, the trunk can swallow two golf bags), there are the AMG performance models, including the V12-powered SL65 with over 600 horsepower and roughly $221,000 price tag.","Despite having just two seats and offering up engines packing as much as 621 horsepower, the new Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is no sports car.

BITURBO V6 ENGINE
 We know a bargain when we see one and the new 2017 Mercedes-Benz SL450 qualifies. For $20,000 less than the V8-powered SL550, the SL450 packs equal amounts of style and luxury. Plus a wonderfully smooth 362-horsepower twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 engine and sub-5-second 0-60-mph acceleration.
 
 MAGIC SKY CONTROL
 Forget the name, it ain’t magic. But it’s definitely one of the coolest things we’ve ever seen. At the touch of a button, this $2,500 option instantaneously alters the transparency of the new SL’s roof panel by applying electrical current, delivering sunshine on your shoulder, but without messing your hair.","","More style and more power for 2017, the new SL gets a full front-end redo drawing inspiration from its iconic race-car lineage. Also new is the SL450 model, which replaces the SL400. Power jumps from 329 to 362 horsepower and it, along with the SL550, gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission.; For 2017, the new Mercedes-Bens SL gets a front-end restyle, drawing inspiration from its iconic lineage. It looks better. It’s a successful marriage of modern style and timeless long-hood/short-deck proportions.

Leather upholstery is standard, as are heated 12-way-power seats with memory, and a power wind-blocker to help minimize wind-mussed hair. Also standard is Mercedes-Benz's COMAND system with navigation, Bluetooth and satellite radio running through the harman/kardon audio system. Standard on V8 models are Mercedes' Airscarf neck-level heating system, driver-selectable adaptive suspension and a hands-free system to open the trunk.

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK combines the dual pleasures of a hardtop 2-seat coupe and a premium luxury roadster. Either way, it coddles you around town, offers a premium driving experience you expect from Mercedes-Benz, and looks great doing it.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If you're tall enough for people to assume you're great at basketball, you're going to find the Mercedes-Benz SLK a tight fit. A 4-seat convertible may suit you better, like the Audi A5/S5 or the new C-Class convertible. Enthusiast drivers will gravitate to the BMW Z4 or the Porsche Boxster.","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class has the best kind of split personality. At first it's a secure, cozy coupe, but with the push of a button, it's a fun-loving open-air roadster thanks to the hardtop convertible top. Like the BMW Z4, its transformer-like ability isn't just a neat parlor trick, it actually adds a dose of practicality to the SLK. This year, the 2016 SLK300 takes the place of last year's SLK250, with a more powerful engine and new 9-speed automatic transmission. But unless you're choosing the 415-horsepower AMG SLK55, the Mercedes-Benz SLK skews more toward plusher ride compared to rivals like the Z4, the Audi TT and the Porsche Boxster. And of course, fundamental to SLK luxury roadsters are the prestige and pampering inherent in Mercedes-Benz vehicles.","We're fans of the new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder now available in the 2016 SLK300, having sampled it in vehicles like the new C-Class sedan and GLC-Class luxury SUV.

RETRACTABLE HARDTOP
 The SLK-Class didn't invent the retractable hardtop, but it made it mainstream when the roadster debuted in 1998. It's easy to see why the technology became commonplace: In less than 20 seconds, the SLK can transform from buttoned-down coupe to sun-seeking convertible.
 
 AIRSCARF & AIR GUIDES
 Even convertible die-hards get cold, so to make the SLK-Class as all-weather as possible, Mercedes-Benz engineers developed adjustable Air Guide draft deflectors on each rollbar and the Airscarf system, which delivers warm air to your neck from an outlet in the headrest.","","The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class gets a new engine and model designation to go with it. A 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder backed by a new 9-speed automatic transmission now anchors the bottom of the line in the new SLK300. Option packages are simplified, and the manual transmission for the now-defunct SLK250 disappears.; The 2016 SLK-Class boasts the classic long-hood/short-trunk profile that defines a roadster. Top up, it looks like a luxurious coupe, and you might even be hard-pressed to tell that the top goes down at all. Yet press the button and it retracts in 20 seconds, giving you the open-air thrills you long for. It's small too, just a few inches longer than a Mazda Miata, making it easy to maneuver around town and in tight parking places. The AMG SLK55 model uses tinted headlight housings, quad exhaust outlets and a small rear spoiler to up the visual adrenaline.","Along with the new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and 9-speed automatic transmission, the base 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK300 also comes with a 5.8-inch infotainment display, an 8-speaker audio system with a USB port and Bluetooth streaming, auto-dimming mirrors and 8-way-power seats. That retractable roof also features a standard panoramic glass panel. There's an Eco mode that includes automatic start/stop to help save a few drops of fuel at stoplights, and an attention-assist feature that monitors the driver for drowsiness. Other safety features include active head restraints, along with plenty of airbags and stability control.","Optional Equipment 
Beyond opting for V6 or V8 engines, options are mostly divided into groups, and even those are simplified for the 2016 model year. The Premium 1 package adds the Airscarf, heated seats, keyless ignition and entry, and remote hardtop operation, plus an upgraded audio system. A Premium 2 package adds active high beams, brighter headlights, navigation, dual-zone climate control, and more. The Premium 3 package includes active cruise control and lane-keeping assist, parking assist and an adaptive suspension. Stand-alone options include the Magic Sky Control roof, and if you want extreme customization, there's the Designo exterior and interior trim.","Pricing Notes 
 
For 2016, the Mercedes-Benz SLK300 comes with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $48,000, including the $925 destination charge. That's not bad, but options quickly up the price. For example, if you want any color besides black, white or red, you're paying at least an extra $720 for the privilege. The SLK 350 starts at a little more than $60,000, while the AMG SLK55 is more than $73,500. Despite this, at the low end the SLK actually undercuts the more powerful BMW Z4 by a couple thousand dollars, with the margin even wider between the Benz and Porsche Boxster. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Mercedes roadster. The 2016 SLK's resale value is expected to be good. Four-cylinder variants are predicted to best hold their value but still match the Porsche Boxster.

However, credit the company's AMG division for the real news: the introduction of the 2017 Mercedes-AMG SLC43. With a 362-horsepower 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 driving the rear wheels, the new SLC43 transforms the SLC from a fun roadster into something approximating a luxurious muscle car. But even the standard SLC300 is no slouch, and we're not just talking about the powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. With a power hardtop, a comfortable ride and the luxury inherent to the Mercedes-Benz brand, the SLC is a comfortable and luxurious alternative to the BMW Z4, Audi TT and Porsche Boxster.","To be clear, we're fans of the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that's standard issue in the 2017 SLC300.

 Lots of convertibles these days have retractable hardtops. However, they don't have the Mercedes-Benz exclusive Magic Sky Control. With a push of a button, the glass in the roof panel goes from opaque to clear, giving you the feeling of open-air driving without the mussed hairdo.
 
 AIRSCARF & AIR GUIDES
 It's fun to drive a convertible on a cold day, but not if you're getting chilled. To keep you warm, the SLC-Class has adjustable Air Guide draft deflectors on each rollbar, and the Airscarf system to blow warm air on your neck from an outlet in the headrest.","","In addition to a new name, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC gets a new model: the Mercedes-AMG SLC43.

Still you'd be hard pressed to tell it's actually a convertible unless you see it with the top down, and then you're in for more of a visual treat.

Include the $925 destination charge, and the base-model 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 starts at about $49,000, which isn't too bad. However, those option packages add up quickly, and with the Premium 3 package, you'll add about $10,000 to the bottom line. The Mercedes-AMG SLC43 starts a little over the $61,000 mark, and the same thing applies as far as options go.

No matter which Sprinter you choose, it offers good maneuverability (relatively speaking) and highway...","Favorite Features 
 
4-WHEEL DRIVE
 If you want a 4WD cargo van, the Sprinter is now your only option. Whether you use yours for getting to an off-highway worksite or as a rugged family adventure mobile, the 4WD Sprinter offers better traction and can even be had with low-range gearing for only a few hundred dollars more.
 
 CROSSWIND ASSIST
 The tallest and longest 2016 Sprinter van is 10 feet tall and 24 feet long, so high winds spell trouble. The standard Crosswind Assist safety feature uses the Mercedes Sprinter’s electronic stability control to push back against Mother Nature.","","2016 marks the debut of the Sprinter Worker, a simplified Mercedes cargo van. Offered in the shortest wheelbase (144 inches) and with standard roof height, this model is aimed at workman and businesses on a budget. Other 2016 models get additional airbags, and 4WD Sprinters gain Downhill Speed Regulation.; Mercedes boasts that the Sprinter was ahead of its time when it brought its pragmatic, high-roof, European style to the U.S. years ago. Now, rivals like the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster have followed suit. It should be no surprise that form follows function for the Sprinter, as it's a rolling rectangle on wheels with a short hood. Three roof heights and three lengths are available, expanding the size of that rectangle -- and more important, the size inside -- considerably. At its largest, the Sprinter is over 24 feet long and 10 feet high.","The new, base Sprinter Worker is the simplest model in the lineup, a cargo van available only in white. Along with a diesel engine, its major standard features include power windows, air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel and 4-speaker audio system with Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The van also features the Load-Adaptive Electronic Stability Program that takes into account load and center of gravity to optimize control when traction is compromised.","Optional Equipment 
Like Mercedes' luxury vehicles, many options are available for the Sprinter cargo van. Unlike Mercedes' cars, however, outside of the heated faux leather seats, most options are aimed at pragmatics and safety. Among the options we most recommend are a rearview camera and parking-aid system. Other recommendable extras are blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and collision-prevention assist. Navigation is also available. Four-wheel drive is available, as is a more powerful diesel V6 engine.","Pricing Notes 
 
With the introduction of the Sprinter Worker, price of entry for Mercedes' big work van just got more digestible. That base model has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $33,490. That's $4,000 less than the previous base cargo van. Of course, the Sprinter Worker is limited in features and comes only in white. Passenger models start just under $42,000. These prices can rise by $10,000 and even $20,000 depending on model and options. Not too surprisingly, Mercedes' commercial vans are pricier than those from Ford, Nissan and Ram, though with the introduction of the Worker, that gap has narrowed. A Ford Transit starts just over $32,000, while the Nissan NV is under $28,000. To make sure you're getting the best deal, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. Given the Mercedes name and its strong diesel engines, we expect the Sprinter's resale value to be better than that of its rivals.

Every premium-performance car serves as a great barroom number generator, but the 2016 Mercedes-AMG GT pairs those bragging rights with an inimitable dose of driving passion and visceral engagement. Simply put, the AMG GT is much more than simply an instrument of speed.","You May Not Like This Car If... 
If pure performance trumps all, the more affordable 2017 Nissan GT-R or 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S might be worth your consideration.","As electronics burrow their way into every facet of modern automobiles, many high-end sports cars have transformed into cold, calculated speed machines. Though utterly cutting-edge, the first-ever Mercedes-AMG GT and higher-performing GT S variant contain something an algorithm could never replicate: a soul. Vertigo-inducing acceleration, catlike cornering abilities, and aluminum body panels fused together as if sculpted by the gods tell only a fraction of the story. Then again, with prices ranging from roughly $110,000 to well over $170,000, the 2016 AMG GT must contend with vaunted nameplates like the Porsche 911 Carrera S, Jaguar F-Type R and Audi R8 V10. Yet, in our opinion, this new kid on the block now has the largest target on its back.","One of the harshest criticisms leveled against AMG models of yore was their punishing ride on average American roadways. The AMG GT, however, is surprisingly livable. Pick up the pace,...","Favorite Features 
 
AMG HIGH-PERFORMANCE BRAKES
 Building a fast car isn’t particularly difficult by today’s standards. Getting a fast car to stop swiftly and smoothly in nearly every situation is a different story, but the GT S’s 15.4-inch front brakes bound by 6-piston calipers are up to the task.
 
 BURMESTER AUDIO
 It may be unrelated to performance, but the standard Burmester audio system is hard to ignore. The 10-speaker arrangement delivers the crisp highs, clean mids, and hard-hitting lows expected of a top-tier audio system.","Although they are a bit firm for our tastes, the seats do an admirable job of holding you in place during spirited driving thanks to power-adjustable leg and side bolsters. Nestled between the seats is a unique-yet-minimally-functional center console designed to resemble the layout of a V8 engine. Explore the space, and you can alter things like drive modes, suspension firmness and exhaust volume. On a more practical note, opening the GT’s rear liftback exposes a very respectable 12.3 cubic feet of cargo space, enough to accommodate two golf bags.","While not a direct descendent of the SLS, the AMG GT is its closest living relative. Seductively sculpted lines and elegantly edgy proportions recall not only the SLS, but other iconic Mercedes-Benz sports cars dating back nearly a half-century (see Mercedes 190SL, 300SL). The long hood, short deck, functional side vents and retractable rear spoiler produce a look so special that it spawned a new hyphenated subdivision dubbed Mercedes-AMG.","Unlike the Porsche 911, the Mercedes-AMG GT comes notably well-equipped with niceties like heated AMG performance seats with memory wrapped in Nappa leather, keyless access and start, eight airbags, navigation with an 8.4-inch display and audio by Burmester, full LED headlights with automatic high beams, a rearview camera, and adaptive cruise control.","Optional Equipment 
Add-ons consist of a widened powerband suitable for race situations, matte-carbon-fiber interior trim, carbon-fiber exterior accents, six staggered wheel options, softer leathers, a panoramic moonroof, lane-departure warning and blind-spot monitoring, which we highly recommend due to the GT’s limited rearward visibility.","Under the Hood 
 
Longitudinal g-forces come courtesy of a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that puts out 456 horsepower in the GT and 503 horsepower in GT S models. In this day and age when you can purchase a 600-plus-horsepower sports car like a Dodge Challenger Hellcat or Corvette Z06 for under $80,000, the GTS’s 3.7-second 0-60 sprint and 193-mph top speed might seem a bit underwhelming to discerning Vin Diesel types. But it’s the seamless, almost graceful way in which the GT and GTS deliver their power that distinguishes them from less expensive and decidedly less refined rivals. Directing all that velvety power to the rear wheels is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that clicks off gear changes so fast that the tach needle can barely keep up.

To keep it competitive against rivals like the Audi R8 ($117,000), Jaguar F-Type R ($104,000), and high-end Porsche 911 models (Carrera S $104,000, 911 Turbo $151,000), the 2016 Mercedes-AMG GT S opens with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just north of $130,000, with the standard version checking in right around $110,000. Go nuts with the options sheet and you can easily tack on more than $40,000 to the base sticker price.

As a brand-new nameplate, Kelley Blue Book has yet to determine the AMG GT’s long-term residual values.
