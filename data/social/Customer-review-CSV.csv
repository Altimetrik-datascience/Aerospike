Although I was very fond of the BMW xDrive system, especially in North Western winters, the ESP in the MB has proven to do an admirable job in wet conditions. The car handles corners every bit as well as the BMW I tested. The biggest decider was the engine power and the seats. The 1.8L turbo makes impressive power and accelerates out of the corners much harder than the BMWs bi-turbo 4. The seats keep you well planted during hard maneuvering and yet comfortable for long cruises. I took the car on a 6 hour road trip and never felt the slightest bit uncomfortable. I also had no problem overtaking on the freeway in Idaho with 80mph speed limits and a full load of 4 people in the car. The seat warmers are amazing, too. The back seats are very comfortable and offer good leg room and head space even for someone who is 6'1"" like me. The styling is excellent. Mine is black with aluminum accents and it looks stunning. The large sunroof is a major plus when the weather is nice out. The feedback and ride quality are great but could be improved with non run flat tires. Harmon/Kardon stereo delivers superb sound. Trunk space is ample. Now for the downer bits. The back seatbelt can be a bit of a pain as it tries to lock up on you and sometimes requires multiple attempts before it will give you enough slack to be comfortable. The back seats in the Coupe are also a bit of a pain to get in and out of owing to the fact that they are fairly far back in the cabin. The entertainment system is fairly easy to operate but could be better. Every time I plug my phone into the USB port to charge it automatically connects the stereo to it despite not having any music. This is a bit annoying. The paddle shifters are nearly useless even in sport mode. Manual gear selection is really only good for downshifting before entering corners but it is still sluggish and uninspiring. By far the biggest disappointment. Forget trying to upshift with it. When accelerating in a straight line in sport mode it will shift when it is ready to and not a millisecond before. Still, the gear ratios on the 7-speed transmission are well balanced and it shifts near seamlessly in economy mode. Overall this car is a joy to drive both spiritedly and casually. I do not regret my purchase at all.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 8

Although I was very fond of the BMW xDrive system, especially in North Western winters, the ESP in the MB has proven to do an admirable job in wet conditions. The car handles corners every bit as well as the BMW I tested. The biggest decider was the engine power and the seats. The 1.8L turbo makes impressive power and accelerates out of the corners much harder than the BMWs bi-turbo 4. The seats keep you well planted during hard maneuvering and yet comfortable for long cruises. I took the car on a 6 hour road trip and never felt the slightest bit uncomfortable. I also had no problem overtaking on the freeway in Idaho with 80mph speed limits and a full load of 4 people in the car. The seat warmers are amazing, too. The back seats are very comfortable and offer good leg room and head space even for someone who is 6'1"" like me. The styling is excellent. Mine is black with aluminum accents and it looks stunning. The large sunroof is a major plus when the weather is nice out. The feedback and ride quality are great but could be improved with non run flat tires. Harmon/Kardon stereo delivers superb sound. Trunk space is ample. Now for the downer bits. The back seatbelt can be a bit of a pain as it tries to lock up on you and sometimes requires multiple attempts before it will give you enough slack to be comfortable. The back seats in the Coupe are also a bit of a pain to get in and out of owing to the fact that they are fairly far back in the cabin. The entertainment system is fairly easy to operate but could be better. Every time I plug my phone into the USB port to charge it automatically connects the stereo to it despite not having any music. This is a bit annoying. The paddle shifters are nearly useless even in sport mode. Manual gear selection is really only good for downshifting before entering corners but it is still sluggish and uninspiring. By far the biggest disappointment. Forget trying to upshift with it. When accelerating in a straight line in sport mode it will shift when it is ready to and not a millisecond before. Still, the gear ratios on the 7-speed transmission are well balanced and it shifts near seamlessly in economy mode. Overall this car is a joy to drive both spiritedly and casually.

This car is very fun to drive as the acceleration in sport mode is pretty awesome. Sport mode lets you drive in a spirited fashion, where comfort mode really reduces the power and will drive as a completely different car. The navigation system is weird, and not user friendly, as some other controls are as well, but once you get used to them, its not an issue. The only complaint/warning I would give potential buyers is about the $2250 optional sport recaro racing seats. This is advertised as a significant optional item and it is, but I will tell you that they are not a comfort seat. It will take you a long time to adjust it in every which way you can to get comfortable. I have finally found some seating positions that are comfortable, but nothing like other car seats. On the positive side of these seats, they really grip you and keep you planted in the seat when you are driving fast and taking corners fast as well.

You cannot fairly compare this car to, say, a BMW 320 or a Mercedes C300. This is a compact luxury coupe that happens to have 4 doors. It is not a closer to mid-sized sedan like the ones mentioned above. Keep that in mind when you read peoples reviews. The CLA250 is in a niche (test) market. The only real direct competitors at this time are the Acura ILX, BMW 228, and Audi A3. The BMW 228 is a 2 door, so that isn't exactly the same class. Nevertheless, these cars are aimed at people that want a lower price point luxury vehicle with great fuel economy and smaller dimensions. Lexus, Infiniti, etc., don't make a competitor vehicle. Maybe you could throw in maxed out Altima's, Camry's, and Accord's, but that would be a stretch to call those luxury vehicles. Having said all that, the CLA 250 is a fantastic car in its class. The interior feels very premium at this price point. The console layout is great and feels like modern premium. Its well thought out and has all the right touches one would expect in a luxury vehicle. The BMW feels antiquated by comparison, while the Audi is just plain terrible. The Acura ILX actually has the next best console/cockpit layout and feel after the CLA250. The front seating on all four cars are what one would expect in a compact luxury car. If you are much taller than average, you will feel cramped. For people of average height and lower, there is plenty of comfort and room to be had. None are the clear winner in this respect. You will just have to experience each of them and judge for yourself. In our opinion, the MB power seating controls, seat heating, and other minor nuances, are what place it at the top. The rear seating on all four cars is cramped, even for a compact car. Again, there isn't a clear winner here. Taller adults will struggle to get comfortable back there. MB does give the back seating some nice touches, though, that are absent or just not as nice on others. Overall, MB gives the rear seating more of the premium treatment than others. Performance is best on the BMW. It is the sportiest, quickest, turns the best, and so on. This may not be supported by test reports, but that is how it feels compared to the others. MB has the best ride, although, it is not great by any measure. Your best bet is the get the 17 inch wheels if comfort is on your mind. The 18 inch wheels do make it sportier and turn better, but you get more road feedback. The CLA 250 gets top marks in the economy battle outside of the Audi A3 Diesel (which is a $3000 option). Nothing much to say here. 26 city / 38 highway is outstanding for a car that also can do 0-60mph in about 6 seconds. The MSRP price of the CLA250 was the second best after the Acura ILX when compared to similarly equipped vehicles. We found that MB was the most willing to negotiate savings off the MSRP (during the Summer), though, and also gave the most for our trade. Acura and BMW wouldn't budge below 4% under MSRP, and that was on their loaner cars. Audi wasn't willing to go more than 6% under MSRP. MB was offering 10% off MSRP without even trying on any in stock brand new car. MB offered us at least $1000 more for the trade, too. The overall deal was clearly the best amongst these four cars. Overall, you just cant beat what Mercedes put together on the CLA250. It really comes down to preference, though. Some would rather sacrifice the premium for more sport. Some would rather sacrifice economy for more rear seat room. It really is in the eye of the beholder. For everything we valued, the CLA250 was the runaway winner, with no real close second. If we had to rank them, it would be MB CLA250 in front, followed by Acura ILX, BMW 228 and Audi A3. The Acura is perhaps the bang for your buck leader after the CLA250. If you can find the right dealer at the right time, you may be able to get a better deal on it versus the CLA250. BMW is the clear sport luxury leader, where the emphasis is on sport. The performance is outstanding for a vehicle in this class. Audi is dead last. It is not a very good vehicle at all. The console/cockpit is atrocious. That alone is enough to walk on by. The ride is bad, the economy is sub-par, and the list goes on. I would be happy to own the CLA250, ILX or 228, as they are all great vehicles in their own way. I would pass on the Audi A3.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 10

I have always been happy with the value of Mercedes-Benz vehicles as they seem to maintain a strong value per cost as time goes by. Further, it is typically hard to find any AMG at under $100,000 sticker price. Even with some of the added features on mine, the sticker price did come in under $100k when new (Note: I purchased it as a Certified Pre-Owned as I do with all of my vehicles). Thus, I give it a 10/10 for value. In terms of reliability, I gave it a 10/10 as I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Granted I have only had it about one month, but all was perfect so far (knock on wood lol). In terms of Quality, again a 10/10 as the car even has a look of strength, power and durability. Mercedes-Benz always does a great job (IMO) of ensuring their vehicles are of the highest quality! Driving Dynamics - simply amazing! The car launches like a bullet in quick acceleration and corners beautifully. The suspension shifts the weight in proper proportions in any situation/condition. 10/10 The design I gave a 9/10 but that is being very nit-picky. I would have given it a 10/10 if it were not for the design of the COMAND system. The location of the knob/wheel to control it, is in a location where it is very easy to accidentally bump. Maybe moving it closer to the center would help (touchscreen would be nice too). Also, the cup holders are very small (I drink Fiji water and it is hard to fit it in the cup holders - also part of that is due to the dumb square design of Fiji bottles lol). The exterior design is beautiful! The illuminated star would be my only gripe. It is not very bright and difficult to understand when it is on and when it is not (does not flash with the headlights, etc). Comfort and Convenience I also gave 9/10 being very nit-picky. The mBrace 2 system/options are simply amazing. The in-vehicle internet is dial-up modem speed (ahhhh lol). Also, I have owned a 2012 C300 which seemed to have some nice features/options I do not have on this one (Gracenote music, etc.). Also convenient would be if the back-up camera had a front view as well (and even side views - my wife's Infiniti EX35 has this) and audible sensors could also be helpful but again these are not ""complaints"" - simply the only things missing for a 10/10. ;-) Overall I gave it a 10/10 because it is an amazing car!

I use the car primarily for long-distance trips and prefer back roads over the interstate highways. Strengths include exceptional engine performance and brakes. I've owned two C7 Corvettes, and for all practical purposes the AMG can accelerate and pass as well as they could on public roads. More surprisingly, the fuel economy has been significantly better than I anticipated. When driven normally I get about 26 MPG in town and over 32 MPG on the open road. Obviously, when pushed hard the mileage suffers accordingly, but that is to be expected. The car is comfortable although the ride is firm which is what I prefer. I deliberately stayed with the standard equipment 18""wheels rather than the optional 19"". Likewise, I choose standard, non run-flat tires which I detest. Dislikes include the audio system, which sounds fine, but is ridiculously complex to operate. The controls on my 2009 Cobalt work just as well and are infinitely simpler to use. What I can do with one push of a button on the Cobalt requires three and sometimes four button actions on the Mercedes. Just stupid! Likewise, the display screen in the middle of the dashboard works OK, but simply looks like an ""add-on"". The electronic steering is ""over-assisted"" in my opinion and doesn't provide the feedback I like/expect from a performance car. Also, this is the first car I've owned that had the dual clutch transmission. I'm not impressed. It's not as smooth as an automatic and no where near as fun/engaging as a manual. Likewise, the ""stop/start"" engine feature works as advertised when the ""ECO"" mode, but has a slight delay after brake release before the engine starts, which can be disconcerting when turning left across traffic.

I have had zero issues with the car so far. I wanted a faster car that could also hold it's own in the snow and this car does exactly that. At just over 200hp, it's not a speed demon on the highway, but it is very zippy around town and extremely smooth and quiet on the highway. The front wheel drive combined with the traction control system are phenomenal in the snow, it hardly feels like driving in snow at all. I drive pretty quickly most of the time and average around 32mpg which I am very pleased with. The only gripe I have with the car is that it is small for larger drivers. I am 6'4"" and the driver's seat goes back plenty far to be comfortable, but it does lack head room. I feel like my head is almost always about to touch the roof which I don't like. Note: My car has the panoramic roof which does limit the amount of head room. I drove a CLA without the glass roof and there seemed to be a couple more inches of space... The back seat is tiny, but what else can you expect from what MB calls a ""4 door coupe"".

Went in to buy a 2 yr. old off lease C300 4matic but wife saw the Jupiter Red CLA on the showroom floor and fell in love with it. Two weeks on and all is well. I'm a long time M-B owner but always 2 or 3 generations behind, so I'm excited to have one of their newest products. Was concerned about ""newness"" factor but salesman the chassis had been in development for 5 years in Europe as the A class people carrier before coming to the USA. CLA handled well during the test drive with ride being pretty firm, which I like, but our car also has the 18"" wheels with 40 series tires. Acceptable power from the 4 cyl engine, and changing into ""Sport"" mode definitely helped the acceleration. ""Eco"" mode shuts the car off at stops which takes some getting used to, but AC and other accessories seem to keep working so no problem there. Also like the interior look and feel. M-B text looks like leather and the stitching in the door panel and seats impressed my wife. Interior lighting layout is nice as well. I liked being able to buy a front drive car from Mercedes instead of all wheel drive for the Chicago winters. Was also looking for a fuel economy improvement over C300 which we got as well. Yes back seat is small but I'm 6ft and can get in and out OK. Not great for cross country but would handle 4 adults for a day trip nicely. Nice size trunk and flexibility of fold down rear seats will help make this a great everyday car once the newness wears off. Since our car was Certified Pre-Owned we received and extra year on the factory warranty and unlimited mileage. Purchased an extra two year warranty for $2450 giving us a total 6.25 years of warranty and unlimited mileage. Hoping I don't need to use any of it but we plan on keeping the car so thought it was good investment long term.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 9

Even though Lexus is a well built car, I was thoroughly impressed with the design/ease of use, handling, reliability, and gas mileages of my E-350 4-Matic Luxury sedan. I consider MB is a notch above Lexus, not just the name but also the car itself. The style of my car is not too flashy and it is a solid and well built car for senior. In terms of all wheel drive, my son-in-law has a Subaru AWD but the handling of Subaru is not nearly as easy as E-350 4-Matic. Subaru was very stiff in handling while MB is not. If you live in a colder climate, 4-Matic is a highly recommended option since you need not to worry about snow or slippery road with 4-Matic. In Southeastern PA, I do not need snow tires for Winter. The only issue I have with MB is its rate of depreciation. I cannot understand why such a good car depreciates so fast vis-a-vis Lexus.

I have a 400 h.p. V8 engine and whenever I need to rapidly accelerate from a stopped position my tires slip up something terribly and I start slower than if I still owned a E350. My suggestion, regardless of where you live (I live in sunny Southern Texas), get the 4 matic. The traction is just terrible. 2) The second issue pertains to a manufacturing defect that the dealership can't seem to address correctly. The dash piece at the foot of the inside windshield has a ""loose clip"" and vibrates to the point it drives me nuts. I took it to the dealership and they fixed it, only to leave me with a new vibration in the same part, just closer to the center.

It has been a great car on the road and off the road for the power. I would say it is more luxuries and security car rather than convenience and comfortableness. First of all, no one can leave the car unless driver unlocks the car so it is kinda annoying. Before when I bought this car, I was dreamed about this car and planned to buy it for a long time. It didn't disappoint me at all but when I take it to the off road I can hear some raddling nose on the back door. I took it to the dealership for repair and I found out it makes that kind of nose often and other customers also noticed it because extra tire on the back is too heavy for the door and when people take it to the off road it just started making a noise. It didn't cost me allot, they just have to strengthen the back lock but it was annoying for me to go back to dealership for this situation once or twice a month because I take the car off road allot and finally I took off the extra tire on the back and it stopped making a noise but then it looks so on the back without extra tire. It is a strong car, lovely car, chick magnet car and I have had several SUVs like Landcruiser, Lexus and Range Rover. It was the best of all but I guess it is because I liked it so much. Also it is not a soft car when you take it on the road and if you drive on the road for long hours like me, you will get tired of driving it after several hours. Specially when you take it to the long off road trip, it is hard and uncomfortable. I believe G500 is the one of the best SUV that Mercedes produce but I don't know why they don't upgrade the suspension system and the back lock problem. I heard this problem is passed on to 2005 - 2008 but I heard 2009 has more soft suspension but I haven't tried it yet, if it is true I would like trade my car for it. For the gas mileage, this car is super. it is not comparable to the V6 or V4 but it is a best for V8 car. It is a powerful, super fast car but gas mileage is low for V8 car. Overall, I loved my G500 and I would like to buy new version if they fixed the suspension and back door lock problems. i would recommend this car to someone who loves to drive tough, fast, powerful SUVs but if you are looking for comfortable, convenience, inexpensive car, pls don't buy.""",

A certain online tire dealer (TR) does sell other wheel/tire packages in 18 that fit, so we did manage to put some serious snow shoes on the beast. But, geez MB - we bought the car to DRIVE IN THE SNOW! It is also bone-jarringly bad to ride in. The engineers at AMG must like pain. My track-tuned Mini with solid bushings rode like a dream compared to this car. The seats are terrible - I have had both the regular recaros and the sport versions - they both are cripplingly bad.

I can highly recommend this car if its NOT your only driver, if you dont mind fighting with MB and the dealer over repairs, and you enjoy the car going into safe mode at 70MPH on the interstate while a tractor trailer barrels down on you and your now screaming kids.

The fact that it was a Mercedes made the decision easier for me as I knew it would be a car that would be flawless and have unmatched resale value. I purchase a new 2016 GLA 250 on July 18, 2016. After driving my brand new GLA for only 2 weeks, I took it in for an unusual wind noise coming from the driver's side window.

This car in my opinion drove better then the RDX and my daughters X3 I drove for a week while looking for a car. The nine speed automatic was surprisingly very smooth and I didn't have any problems with it. Even though the GLC starts at around $38,000, with all of the options I wanted, the grand total ended up being around $61,000. For this price, I got the multimedia package, interior package, red designo paint, white designo interior, premium sound system, heads up display, night package with upgraded wheels, a panoramic roof, and many more smaller options. At first while driving the car home, the heads up display was kind of irritating but I soon got used to it. The biggest problem I have about this car is the confusing infotainment system. There are three different ways to control it and each is more confusing then the last. I end up just using the voice control button and tell it what I want to do. The second problem I have with this car is the gear selector. It is located where most cars have your windshield wiper controls are and kind of throws me off before I remember how to control it. Other then that the GLC is perfect. The quality of materials is top notch, it drives exceptionally, and gets great gas mileage compared to my last car.

Although the Acura was nice when I test drove it, they didn't have the right color I wanted, so I went to Mercedes to try the new GLC. This car in my opinion drove better then the RDX and my daughters X3 I drove for a week while looking for a car. The nine speed automatic was surprisingly very smooth and I didn't have any problems with it. Even though the GLC starts at around $38,000, with all of the options I wanted, the grand total ended up being around $61,000. For this price, I got the multimedia package, interior package, red designo paint, white designo interior, premium sound system, heads up display, night package with upgraded wheels, a panoramic roof, and many more smaller options. At first while driving the car home, the heads up display was kind of irritating but I soon got used to it. The biggest problem I have about this car is the confusing infotainment system. There are three different ways to control it and each is more confusing then the last. I end up just using the voice control button and tell it what I want to do. The second problem I have with this car is the gear selector. It is located where most cars have your windshield wiper controls are and kind of throws me off before I remember how to control it. Other then that the GLC is perfect. The quality of materials is top notch, it drives exceptionally, and gets great gas mileage compared to my last car. I can easily see living with the new GLC for the next 5-10 years and would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact luxury SUV.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 10

This car is very fun to drive as the acceleration in sport mode is pretty awesome. Sport mode lets you drive in a spirited fashion, where comfort mode really reduces the power and will drive as a completely different car. The navigation system is weird, and not user friendly, as some other controls are as well, but once you get used to them, its not an issue. The only complaint/warning I would give potential buyers is about the $2250 optional sport recaro racing seats. This is advertised as a significant optional item and it is, but I will tell you that they are not a comfort seat. It will take you a long time to adjust it in every which way you can to get comfortable. I have finally found some seating positions that are comfortable, but nothing like other car seats. On the positive side of these seats, they really grip you and keep you planted in the seat when you are driving fast and taking corners fast as well.

You cannot fairly compare this car to, say, a BMW 320 or a Mercedes C300. This is a compact luxury coupe that happens to have 4 doors. It is not a closer to mid-sized sedan like the ones mentioned above. Keep that in mind when you read peoples reviews. The CLA250 is in a niche (test) market. The only real direct competitors at this time are the Acura ILX, BMW 228, and Audi A3. The BMW 228 is a 2 door, so that isn't exactly the same class. Nevertheless, these cars are aimed at people that want a lower price point luxury vehicle with great fuel economy and smaller dimensions. Lexus, Infiniti, etc., don't make a competitor vehicle. Maybe you could throw in maxed out Altima's, Camry's, and Accord's, but that would be a stretch to call those luxury vehicles. Having said all that, the CLA 250 is a fantastic car in its class. The interior feels very premium at this price point. The console layout is great and feels like modern premium. Its well thought out and has all the right touches one would expect in a luxury vehicle. The BMW feels antiquated by comparison, while the Audi is just plain terrible. The Acura ILX actually has the next best console/cockpit layout and feel after the CLA250. The front seating on all four cars are what one would expect in a compact luxury car. If you are much taller than average, you will feel cramped. For people of average height and lower, there is plenty of comfort and room to be had. None are the clear winner in this respect. You will just have to experience each of them and judge for yourself. In our opinion, the MB power seating controls, seat heating, and other minor nuances, are what place it at the top. The rear seating on all four cars is cramped, even for a compact car. Again, there isn't a clear winner here. Taller adults will struggle to get comfortable back there. MB does give the back seating some nice touches, though, that are absent or just not as nice on others. Overall, MB gives the rear seating more of the premium treatment than others. Performance is best on the BMW. It is the sportiest, quickest, turns the best, and so on. This may not be supported by test reports, but that is how it feels compared to the others. MB has the best ride, although, it is not great by any measure. Your best bet is the get the 17 inch wheels if comfort is on your mind. The 18 inch wheels do make it sportier and turn better, but you get more road feedback. The CLA 250 gets top marks in the economy battle outside of the Audi A3 Diesel (which is a $3000 option). Nothing much to say here. 26 city / 38 highway is outstanding for a car that also can do 0-60mph in about 6 seconds. The MSRP price of the CLA250 was the second best after the Acura ILX when compared to similarly equipped vehicles. We found that MB was the most willing to negotiate savings off the MSRP (during the Summer), though, and also gave the most for our trade. Acura and BMW wouldn't budge below 4% under MSRP, and that was on their loaner cars. Audi wasn't willing to go more than 6% under MSRP. MB was offering 10% off MSRP without even trying on any in stock brand new car. MB offered us at least $1000 more for the trade, too. The overall deal was clearly the best amongst these four cars. Overall, you just cant beat what Mercedes put together on the CLA250. It really comes down to preference, though. Some would rather sacrifice the premium for more sport. Some would rather sacrifice economy for more rear seat room. It really is in the eye of the beholder. For everything we valued, the CLA250 was the runaway winner, with no real close second. If we had to rank them, it would be MB CLA250 in front, followed by Acura ILX, BMW 228 and Audi A3. The Acura is perhaps the bang for your buck leader after the CLA250. If you can find the right dealer at the right time, you may be able to get a better deal on it versus the CLA250. BMW is the clear sport luxury leader, where the emphasis is on sport. The performance is outstanding for a vehicle in this class. Audi is dead last. It is not a very good vehicle at all. The console/cockpit is atrocious. That alone is enough to walk on by. The ride is bad, the economy is sub-par, and the list goes on. I would be happy to own the CLA250, ILX or 228, as they are all great vehicles in their own way. I would pass on the Audi A3.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 10

I have always been happy with the value of Mercedes-Benz vehicles as they seem to maintain a strong value per cost as time goes by. Further, it is typically hard to find any AMG at under $100,000 sticker price. Even with some of the added features on mine, the sticker price did come in under $100k when new (Note: I purchased it as a Certified Pre-Owned as I do with all of my vehicles). Thus, I give it a 10/10 for value. In terms of reliability, I gave it a 10/10 as I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Granted I have only had it about one month, but all was perfect so far (knock on wood lol). In terms of Quality, again a 10/10 as the car even has a look of strength, power and durability. Mercedes-Benz always does a great job (IMO) of ensuring their vehicles are of the highest quality! Driving Dynamics - simply amazing! The car launches like a bullet in quick acceleration and corners beautifully. The suspension shifts the weight in proper proportions in any situation/condition. 10/10 The design I gave a 9/10 but that is being very nit-picky. I would have given it a 10/10 if it were not for the design of the COMAND system. The location of the knob/wheel to control it, is in a location where it is very easy to accidentally bump. Maybe moving it closer to the center would help (touchscreen would be nice too). Also, the cup holders are very small (I drink Fiji water and it is hard to fit it in the cup holders - also part of that is due to the dumb square design of Fiji bottles lol). The exterior design is beautiful! The illuminated star would be my only gripe. It is not very bright and difficult to understand when it is on and when it is not (does not flash with the headlights, etc). Comfort and Convenience I also gave 9/10 being very nit-picky. The mBrace 2 system/options are simply amazing. The in-vehicle internet is dial-up modem speed (ahhhh lol). Also, I have owned a 2012 C300 which seemed to have some nice features/options I do not have on this one (Gracenote music, etc.). Also convenient would be if the back-up camera had a front view as well (and even side views - my wife's Infiniti EX35 has this) and audible sensors could also be helpful but again these are not ""complaints"" - simply the only things missing for a 10/10. ;-) Overall I gave it a 10/10 because it is an amazing car! Highly recommended x 1000!! :-)""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 10

I use the car primarily for long-distance trips and prefer back roads over the interstate highways. Strengths include exceptional engine performance and brakes. I've owned two C7 Corvettes, and for all practical purposes the AMG can accelerate and pass as well as they could on public roads. More surprisingly, the fuel economy has been significantly better than I anticipated. When driven normally I get about 26 MPG in town and over 32 MPG on the open road. Obviously, when pushed hard the mileage suffers accordingly, but that is to be expected. The car is comfortable although the ride is firm which is what I prefer. I deliberately stayed with the standard equipment 18""wheels rather than the optional 19"". Likewise, I choose standard, non run-flat tires which I detest. Dislikes include the audio system, which sounds fine, but is ridiculously complex to operate. The controls on my 2009 Cobalt work just as well and are infinitely simpler to use. What I can do with one push of a button on the Cobalt requires three and sometimes four button actions on the Mercedes. Just stupid! Likewise, the display screen in the middle of the dashboard works OK, but simply looks like an ""add-on"". The electronic steering is ""over-assisted"" in my opinion and doesn't provide the feedback I like/expect from a performance car. Also, this is the first car I've owned that had the dual clutch transmission. I'm not impressed. It's not as smooth as an automatic and no where near as fun/engaging as a manual. Likewise, the ""stop/start"" engine feature works as advertised when the ""ECO"" mode, but has a slight delay after brake release before the engine starts, which can be disconcerting when turning left across traffic. Bottom line: I'm satisfied. It does what I needed it to do, but I miss my Corvette!""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 9

I'm a long time M-B owner but always 2 or 3 generations behind, so I'm excited to have one of their newest products. Was concerned about ""newness"" factor but salesman the chassis had been in development for 5 years in Europe as the A class people carrier before coming to the USA. CLA handled well during the test drive with ride being pretty firm, which I like, but our car also has the 18"" wheels with 40 series tires. Acceptable power from the 4 cyl engine, and changing into ""Sport"" mode definitely helped the acceleration. ""Eco"" mode shuts the car off at stops which takes some getting used to, but AC and other accessories seem to keep working so no problem there. Also like the interior look and feel. M-B text looks like leather and the stitching in the door panel and seats impressed my wife. Interior lighting layout is nice as well. I liked being able to buy a front drive car from Mercedes instead of all wheel drive for the Chicago winters. Was also looking for a fuel economy improvement over C300 which we got as well. Yes back seat is small but I'm 6ft and can get in and out OK. Not great for cross country but would handle 4 adults for a day trip nicely. Nice size trunk and flexibility of fold down rear seats will help make this a great everyday car once the newness wears off. Since our car was Certified Pre-Owned we received and extra year on the factory warranty and unlimited mileage. Purchased an extra two year warranty for $2450 giving us a total 6.25 years of warranty and unlimited mileage.

The first was repurchased my MB after a 6 month struggle over what was deemed as built failures in the electrical, suspension and transmission systems. I was assured the first car was a fluke and that the AMG brand was as reliable as the rest of the MB lineup. WRONG! Now into my second car - 18 months, 37k miles - and the EXACT same issues have caused my car to be in the shop for a total of 5 MONTHS over the past two years. I have, to date had: TWO new rear differentials, five reprogams of the DME, a new transmission, new suspension bushings, etc all the way around, burned through 3 sets of brakes, 2 sets of summer and 3 sets of winter tires due to uneven wear (that MB says is normal and an independent shop verified is the result of a bad suspension geometry), a new rear suspension, and a head replaced. ALL IN 18 MONTHS! With my rant over, I can assure you that you will not find a more fun car to drive in the ice and snow. It behaves like a RWD when you flick it around the corners in slippery conditions. What they dont tell you is THERE ARE NO OEM SNOWS available for this car. Wait...let me get this straight - you sold me an AWD car IN THE WINTER with no snow tires available and on 20 HIGH PERFROMANCE tires? OK.... A certain online tire dealer (TR) does sell other wheel/tire packages in 18 that fit, so we did manage to put some serious snow shoes on the beast. But, geez MB - we bought the car to DRIVE IN THE SNOW! It is also bone-jarringly bad to ride in. The engineers at AMG must like pain. My track-tuned Mini with solid bushings rode like a dream compared to this car. The seats are terrible - I have had both the regular recaros and the sport versions - they both are cripplingly bad. We take our F-450 when we travel more than an hour by car because the AMG ride is that bad! I can highly recommend this car if its NOT your only driver, if you dont mind fighting with MB and the dealer over repairs, and you enjoy the car going into safe mode at 70MPH on the interstate while a tractor trailer barrels down on you and your now screaming kids. Buy this car for a fun rallycross ride that will get the subie folk drooling every time you pull up, or for a track day car that can fit your extras and tires inside. Otherwise, buy ANYTHING else!""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 1

Mercedes only needs to catch up on this age's technology for younger generations. Display would be nice in touchscreen. Although I have not personally experienced it, I hear that the autonomous driving in the Tesla is enhanced over that of the S550.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 10

Looking for more comfort than my previous first generation BMW Z4 Sport, I was inclined to exclude a newer Z4 even though the first one was a total joy to drive for many years. I believe that lighter is always better so a new Boxster seemed to be the best option. However, at 6' 4"" I find the Boxster a bit cramped. The used SL550 was priced about the same as the new Boxster and the seats positively seduced both myself and my wife. The Porsche 14-way seats are not in the same league for comfort or range of thigh support, and the SL has that wonderful active bolstering. The active-bolstered seats are an upgrade I think but if you buy an SL I think you ""gotta have 'em"". The only real competitor for the SL550 is the Porsche 911, which may deliver higher performance on a track but who over takes one of these cars racing? To me the Mercedes has an elegant sophisticated styling, more modern art and less boy racer than the Porsche and to me rounded styling as with the Porsche 911 or the Jaguar XK has lost its luster. The opulent sculpturing of the SL's interior dash is the highest form of automotive art, accented by circular vent openings above spreading wings of rich dark wood. Again, Porsche 911 is not in the same class. Porsche wins easily on resale value. However, this generation SL, with much improved fuel efficieny and driving feel, will likely fare better than the prior generation. Info system? Why doesn't every manufacturer just get with Apple and provide a system that links to the Apple phone? For starters I would like to use map search functions on my iPhone and then send the address to the ""Command"" info system. The driving feel is definitely heavy, not my normal preference, and seems relatively understated for a performance car. Noise, including exhaust note, and road feel are dialed down. However, the sport setting on the suspension transmits nicely cushioned road feel that inspires a bit of spirited driving. Alternatively, the comfort setting is nice on particularly rough roads. This is a very quiet car inside that allows enjoying conversation or the excellent sound system when desired. Add top down and top up versatility and this car can provide a great driving experience in many, many ways.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 9

The 2014 is a vastly improved car in many, may ways- it drives better, handles better, feels more solid and has more power. Candidly, the 2014 feels like a far superior vehicle and makes it almost impossible to believe that I had been driving the same car for 3 years. There are a few knocks however. First, the styling takes some getting used to. The nose of the car maintains a decidedly MB look however the rear and rest of the car feel somehow disconnected and somewhat pedestrian. The rear of the car could be almost any luxury brand based on looks alone. Next, the interior of my car has a pretty bad odor to it. From my past experiences, I realize that MB doesn't not have the typical ""new car"" smell but this vehicle almost smells like a drunk mechanic. I've had the car for less than a week and have an air freshener in the car which is a tragedy given the six figure price of the car. I have reached out to the dealership and am waiting for their reply. Also, the interior redesign, which is far superior to the 2011 also comes with sacrifices. Fit and finish are amazing. The ridiculous cup holders from the old model have been addressed. The seats are on a whole new level comfort-wise. However, the storage spaces are terrible. The fantastic door compartments of the 2011 are gone. Beyond the glove box, the dash has no storage. And, the center console, which was redesigned to make room for cup holders, offers a storage box that opens at the elbow, making it nearly impractical to use as a driver. It makes the day to day driving experience a little frustrating. Finally, the audio system is far superior to that of the 2011, however, the centering of the surround is WAY forward in the car. It sounds like someone is singing from under the hood directly in your face. This hinders the true magic of the new system, which includes the best bass EVER. The SL line of MB is without question their pinnacle of their brand. Driving the 2014 feels like driving a completely new type of car, which isn't a bad thing at all even if it is a quantum leap over the same car. Most of the shortcomings of the car, including the exterior design, are ones that will improve over time, however, the smell and creature comforts you expect in a car of this price are completely lacking and, at times, make me wonder if I have made a mistake in committing to a second SL.""",Likely to recommend this car?

Financially it was an excellent deal. However, we are now stuck with driving this thing another 1 1/2 years before we can turn it in! Compared to the '08 model, this one is a disaster- the most poorly designed (apart from its sexy exterior appearance) and engineered Merc I have had in over 20 years of owning/driving them. Air flow over the bonnet invites rocks to hit the weakest part of the windscreen. Rims bend out of shape after hitting normal potholes- an expensive repair, including the matching tyres! Fuel economy is worse, despite lesser overall performance. I could go on and on, but you get the gist of my points. So, unless you're a guy looking to pick up chicks or a cougar looking for toy boys, find an alternative vehicle to drive and enjoy.""",Likely to recommend this car? (1-10): 1

While the engine and transmittions are well made, I am shocked at how poorly the other elemens of the care are constructed. Additionally, the cost of replacement parts is unbelievely expensive. For example, distributor cap and rotor $365 and yes, you have two of them. EZL, $2800. AC cooler- $3800 Front bumper cover (painted) $2500. Keeping this car up is one of the worlds biggest rip-offs. Stay away from any Mercedes auto. My purchase of one was the greatest finanical move of my life. My SL500 is a 1994 model so I can not begin to think how much more expensive it would be to repair a newer model.""",
